current project(s):

chaos mod Archon - mark III code base port to qc 2.0:

- maphack (rewritten) - finish mod maps
- frikbot - minor rev
- viswep -- needs minor revision, position data tweaks left
- xents --- nearly complete
- morph --- convert done, fixing quirks
* mark I elements to do:		(we hope anyway)
- demi-Archons  in progress
- hold items -- pick up items and carry them
- run fire ---- frames I made to stop weapon fire "ice skating"
- enviro ------ volcano, burning things, rain, floating, etc

quake hack:

-- be able to reload qone & hack levels with map command - have to reload _all_ sub models
- find a way to force all sub models reload

qone:

release followup -

play through / promo video - e1 at least
-- look for oddities
-- wait until archon update is done for this

WIP: v107 archon code - random items from power points

11.28.17

WIP: v107 archon code - random items from power points
DONE: sub loop for spawn_loop code - rnd items can now spawn subsets
\_ like a randomly spawn weapon can add ammo to the level
using '-8 -8 -8' for __archon_maker_rocket_1 messes up spawn of archon points ??
.punchangle does not eject during sub loop

CHECKED: dp has a map base name -- cvar sv_worldbasename is "anomie"
\_ substring(world.model,5,strlen(world.model) - 5);
 \_ adds a global, not much save unless we need that value a lot
WIP: clearing vars check:
CHECKED: search map source - find out if regioned mode is ever used REMOVE this check -- none found in id maps - testplayerstart left wrapped in #debug
CHECKED: weaponmodel stuff -- for fists - wm seems to work fine given that fhists have no wm
CHECKED: does this cause the test_c map teleport train facing issue?? -- indeed was the reason
FIXED: teleport train on test_c leaves fixangle wrong !
CHECKED: monster enemies? -- bot_ai - pkb just not geared for monsters - would req. serious ai recode
CHECKED: attempt fold into multi* -- hip monsters check attacks - all diff from multi code - gremlin is prob. most generic
CHECKING: what d, q2, q3 guy drop in dm when dead -- q3 drops held wep
CHECKED: do the next 2 need moved ? -- ambient stuff in map_hack - moved to env
CHECKED: does this work cli / srv remote - or does this have to be sent to _every_ cli with stuffcmd -- needs stuffcmd send
DONE: _/
CHECKED: ideal - switching back from fists - next test bugs out clb hot prongs -- viswep fists code - clb prongs seem to work fine
NOTE: q2 code - see if pooted out runes make noise -- self.noise4 = "misc/null.wav";

\ axe holster flicks to slot 1 items when other slot items pk_curr != 1 -- have other partial holster issues as well
 \_ hammer & axe both holstered
DONE: update W_ChangeWeapon was code, include pki -- eweap didnt changed, does it need incl
\ when on a pki, and hitting impulse for empty slot, it changes vw display to axe tho wep is still pki
 \_ - changed pk_currentitem to 1, but eweap stayed on item

FIXISH: bad wolf loop bug in  W_BestWeapon -- stuck on a free ent
\_ suspect these vwepent / x_load / viswep freed bugs are from locus getting mispurposed mid fn call -- qc would need to run in parallel for this tho
FIXED: oddball centerprint of world.message -- wep select message when ptr is world
WIP: #unused cleanup started
FIXISH: when wep changes gets v_model wrong for an x_wep
DONE: RankForWeapon doesnt take eweap into account -- needs to use distance but dont have that in weapon or ammo _touch
DONE: botcam #ifdef wrapper adjust
power armor msgs only appear if both held -- turns out this was a design feature so you knew which was on, if you only have one, that must be on
WIP: holster last wep kinda odd -- found logic bug

WIP: hard server tests with 6 bots 
DONE: notes on pk admin commands & ops -- admin.cfg

\_ hubs have a generic script, but individual map scripts still needed for non hub map loop
DONE: debounce t_botpath .touch
DONE: map vote displays -- prev WriteB3 method total remove

DONE: best wep tweaks - pk no blaster deal, lg rank 75, etc.
DONE:
// make your favorite wep always select as best wep if you have it
// favwep weapon_flamer		# favor the flame thrower
// note: doenst work on q1 weps - they are: set  __rprogs/{vwmodel}.mdl	"{rank}"
//		 also wont work if you already have the item

alias favwep "set __$1_distance 99;set __$1_reload 1;reload"
-- and deprecated as well
DONE: noexit deal - ? -- this is the cm2 server code that dealt with frag / timelimit and a map without a trigger_changelevel
DONE: admin - nextlevel code
NIXED: serious slowdown (8 fps) on x4c alpha 0.6 - 9 fps on pkn6 (700 ents)
NOTE: reload cmd in server.cfg delay loading x_items
DONE: add real ply_count to test code
DONE: crosshair impulse 49 replaced with cfg loop
DONE: hub override -- is this working live?  it works on map reloads
|  very quirky, may work live, may need to reload hub, a hub turned off and back on when timesout will load itself anyway
\_ hubs can be turned off, and back on - in theory a hub turned off live can be turned back on

DONE: CycleWeaponCommand doesnt bypass a top slot wep with no ammo for one below that has or is inf ammo
\_ does not select a pk_curr wep imm. when no 1 item in slot -- ref only have prox gun
ARG: 
1. hitting 1 requires an extra tap to advance pki when cycling in -- or
2. hitting 1 auto advances when re-entry from another slot -- you were on turret, select rl, then 1 again - comes back in with beartrap
FIX: put hip laser cannon in right rotate place
_HUH: doin stuff, tests,  opened map crates, had q2 mech hook, touching crates after resp. opens them -- test
FIXED:
Download rejected: server does not have the file "sound/ambient/humming.wav"		-- in _x_6b  - not sure where in pk3 release if at all
Download rejected: server does not have the file "sound/ambient/waterfal.wav"
FIXED: trigger dtype & fact3 ops -- redo map with moving lava door - works if tex is *lava
NOTE: moving lava doors - one brush with *lava, one brush solid tex -- or compiler barfs
NOTE: ran server for 2 days - noticeable slowdown spikes, fps generally over 35

FIXED: pack touch x_load bad loop bug
\ -- might be: bp.weapon   = 2				this should be an mcode > 147 ;  this will have to effect of reloading the just created turret
 \_ might be last bit of e_weap_Attack code - if death occured / pack is thrown, then return to finish wep firing aspect
HUH: painframes - aircannon went to holster / back pos -- also harp, clg
\_ this works properly now ? hrm...
CHECKED: maybe too much rune moving -- timing seems fine on no / bots map
\_ what this might be is when players die and runes eject, they move soon after
DONE: bots keeps busting eweap / viswep_ld - free ents, pointer goes world while firing, etc -- perhaps it is over

FIXING: bots breaking eweap code -- 3rd time
DONE: check actor logic in ego -- changed this to not blast true invuln players
\_ changed this back -- not sure real purpose - seems like they want ego to respect the actor powerup
FIXED: turrets: health           -99.0000	ammo_cells     -18967.0000
-- turret code is now bugged - eweapon can be cleared by e_use_ammo before vals are set
NOTE: with current x_ent setup for pk cary weps - activate fn MUST be called before e_use_ammo [ .use() ]
FIXED: more bots eweap screwage
CHECKED: after a rune is ejected on death, it keeps relocating on short interval for a while
\_ pk12b has a bogus noway_below value ( -1 ) on load -- set in script now

-- seems like the bot self.vwepent pointer was not being cleared - leaving a freed ent, which on re-entry bad looped
-- might have been a bug in viswep logic that didnt always trip -> if (pr) tr = pr;
ISSUE: fryguy may not play happy with frikbot	-- no takedamage, in axe frames, stuck in place
\-- adjust bot_fixer to handle this
 \_ frik must take over think while in conduit jerk frames
FIXED: map codes in HUD for weps that arent showing (aircan, clg, harp)

FIXED: grap swap w/ hammer with grap on bit 128 -- this is the issue of some items having pk_curr unset thus 0, which creates a special case in code
FIXED: have hammer, no lg - going imp 9 then 8 -- hammer gets held as range wep?
\_ this is a select ewep - then hit impulse on empty slot - still on same wep, & eweap ptr is world
DONE: move all hooks to 128 or 256 bit pos -- they almost need another special hook only slot - 8192 bit
NIXED: issue with 8192 bit - then we need a slot to select with an impulse for new cycle code
CHECKED:  handle explodeshells - still need to fix issue w/ axe level & currentitem -- saw no issues
CHECKED: pkbots & inittrigger -- only select triggers are marked - dont want to mark stuff like trigger_hurt

FIXED: tomb_immune_time	now #define as bt_immune_time
CHECKED: ai_frame(self.walkframe) in cm2 -- may possibly need for super-vore, x_scragg, x_demon, x_scourge, x_dog
\_ used for multiframe monsters like super ogre to run higher frame sets off of same loops
DONE: bot touching stuff - no longer have master touch fn like cm2 -- moved bot code to touched() module - all touch come here on success
finished prev -- parm{n} revised for mark III code base (and the "all" added weps [ sys 6 ] are x wep mode viswep stored)

ISSUE: bots get stuck -- refer to:
-- cvar sv_gameplayfix_droptofloorstartsolid_nudgetocorrect is "0" ["1"] tries to nudge stuck items and monsters out of walls before droptofloor is performed
-- cvar sv_gameplayfix_upwardvelocityclearsongroundflag is "1" ["1"] prevents monsters, items, and most other objects from being stuck to the floor when pushed around by damage, and other situations in mods
\_ these may fix, test with monsters too

FIXED: rnd tele dest- copy angles to mangle if mangle 0 0 0
\_ doesnt seem to work -- had to test _y component of vector, and not entire vector
DONE: eweap that can not be swapped with aflag = -1
issue: explode shells are a real pain -- shotgun is tested for swap and not them, so the block doesnt work
FIXED: explode shells gun goes away when ammo runs out -- clears viswep
XXX: explode shooter vwepent is not removed when ammo runs out -- other vwepent dont work this way either
\_ -- still blocks reg shotgun when empty!
-- also block a legit cube when empty!
DONE: doom crate - put in doom room with rnd doom items in cfg -- crate is textured - check it
FIXED: adjust on using SUB_Regen with cvar_fields load & event driving there

\_ the next 2 XXX seem cleared away
XXX: got ammo - explode shooter changed to reg SG -- could not dup on get ammo, but happens on swap out

XXX: issues with pk pulsenail on test_c - v_ was nailgun, swapped to 3 railgun - still showing v_nailgun
-- v models have mucho fuckage - this NEEDS fixed permanently, use cvar dealy
-- this may be a viswep code screwage

REDONE: crates can now have custom models / sounds & respawn - same for exploder (when put in cfg)
REDONE: some cube code / script as well
DONE: ent.def update for cubes / crates
FIXED: cube / crate xwep now shave a new issue where the eweapon reverts to a normal wep after selecting off
-- happens when weps dont have "weapon" slot #
\_ because firecode was doing an assign on newmis - same as nspawn which spawn_loop uses
WIP: swap png with q3 rail - no slug ammo -- all swaps fail to add base wep ammo - was calling item_putis in x_weapon_touch

-- likely all XXX below are fixed now
XXX: invis vw_model from crate stuff -- check reg map items where we have invis issues (pk ng)
XXX: v_model screwage
XXX: cyc weps & nailgun etc. screwage
FIXED?: got ammo, lg3 v_model changed to lg1 -- this happens at other times too, this code really needs solidified

FIXED: swing zombie facing on x4c_4a3
FIXED: cubecont_0 fails -- because __weapon_rocketlauncher has no cfg to translate into
FIXED: adv toolkit ents not solid -- some ents that still event to startitem dont have solid in cfg
FIXED: small map crate no reset model on respawn -- was _def_model deal - cant use on respawners via cvar_fields
FIXED: still have an axe select as pk_currentitem = 2 which is screwed, also leaves eweap set doing weird
-- this is from explode shells being pki 2 - the eweap search sees this

in recent days the _tr initiative is the best code I've put in archon mark III

-- calling this done too
DONE: - spawners for cubes, crates -- including cfg for rnd items
this is replacement for dynamic spawns

FIXED: bad bug in cvar_fields where self was used instead of passed ent
-- self worked when called from SV_OnEntityPreSpawnFunction because it was using self
FIXED: translate items
\_ added a new translate cfg field to ease up on making scripts
-  doesnt seem to translate back real well on loopcyc, but d alpha scripts work great
DONE: punchangle does eject on spawner

DONE:
new trigger / biome system with multiple sets of biome stuff - regular terrain, oceans / bedrock, buildings / villages
multi phases need to - id maphacks in their phase, set biomes in their phase
- use mt (master trigger) as owner
- alt: have trigger dir spec - spawn a thing & face a certain dir
			a main func_maphack loads a set of triggers, that load more triggers radiating out
			null hacks that dont test in probe vs. real world hacks

-- all of that is done in the new multi-tiered biome script system - except this hold hack issue:
HOLD hacks can _still_ overlap each other with no way to delete
- need a recursive change of the mh from a hold instance

11.3.16

WIP: maphack world builder -- outdoor test biome cfg files, production line for outdoor map chunks
WIP: tree templates - couple of decid tree enhances
FIXED: now, not all oh ents are hiding beyond sv_hide dist to hack -- hack_pdist is not being defaulted now
|		one thing is left from hack_pdist: individual ent trace is used for monsters and other things that can be moved
 \_	but this means lone ents can be visible when the building isnt because the bld center is farther away
FIXED: was causing an extra global used: s2__ = field_loop = entityfieldname(1);
ISSUE: if __tr_bld & __tr_biome master trigger does not center with __biome trigger, HOLD sub-hacks do not co-ord correctly
\_ this may not have an easy fix, besides speccing the origin on init
-- ISSUE: server.cfg stuff is not taking effect for _map designate
\_ this was the vs. autoexec deal, and the fix is to spec the cfg file on the command line
-- is there some issue where a maphack gets set to ldfail and then an overlap happens?
\_ ldfail gets used when __tr_bld & __tr_biome have no cfg script, but the trigger inits
XXX: maphack overlap prevention & probe ops -- seems like some overlab & such is happening, esp on 2 highs
\_ feel like this is well in hand now with the discovery of the master trigger origin init issue
NOTE: it seems the droptofloor is a no-go with building loads under func_maphack

WIP: maphack world builder -- outdoor test biome cfg files, production line for outdoor map chunks
WIP: doom lands chunks & build system
FIXED: (sort of) - func_maphack on test_c5 were messing with func_illusionary and door cfg biome triggers
-- prob due to leaving mh global active - fix was moving all func_maphack to end of map file
FIXED: func_maphack on test_c5 were messing with * -- prem fix, this was DESTROYH option not clearing mh global
ISSUE: point light above chunks - reduced 600 to 440 -- fails, leaves chunks fullbright - 550 is better

10.22.16

WIP: maphack world builder -- outdoor test biome cfg files, production line for outdoor map chunks
REV: init is broken after moving cvar_fields - new cfg init leaves initial hacks in ldfail status somehow -- delay on loading any initial maphack
- reverted back to earlier code, above fix caused to many problems
FIXED: init issues fixed by running init biome cfg before loading map -- used a bash fn() to do this
- this fix may have allieviated the overlaps that were seen
DONE: item_rune fix (code had item_sigil which new rune server code changed)

10.21.16

WIP: maphack world builder -- outdoor test biome cfg files, production line for outdoor map chunks
FIXED: hold hacks from test map were getting spawnflag override by cvar_fields in func_maphack code

FIXED:
  server EDICT 0:
classname      vomisss																												*** !should not set
model          maps/OA.bsp

-- this code:  	frame_arb($attack6,if (random() < 0.08) vom_shot(-3); newmis.classname = "vomisss");

research into subhack idea for triggerfield parks and such

9.18.16

WIP: rune code in *.qc
FIXED: runes not ejected on death -- plus suicide and disconnect
ogres and knights appear on dm4_x when using "+set deathmatch 1" -- this is the 'not using -listen' launch deal
for some reason when using the "map dm4" command, rune server doesnt run
WIP: pk maps need bouncy nailgun -- on first map load, this isnt always done via cfg
\- DONE: -- we need to undo this as well 
FIXED: get an ammo box with SG, SSG or LG and 1pv weaponmodel disappears - not on pk maps tho
-- was this line in float() W_BestWeapon - self.eweapon = e1__; 
-- because e1__ was a point to a chain of viswep
FIXED: R_EARTH is 0 after cfg sets it -- messes up rune id
\-- "Unknown - Resistance = 1/2 damage all attacks."
- had to reload rune cfg with a spawner

WIP: qc 2.0
RESEARCH: artifact shells for all morphs -- try darkplaces trick in place of this - see extensions - colormod, glowmod
SPEC: update for weapon cycle loop, translations, dynamic spawns, new ents
- using override script
- need a live update func that uses cvars __lup_{seq#|cfg_name}_{classvn} to indicate which ents to change
- call prespawn code to do update after running next script -- think call fn, run cfg, next think call does update
- copy worldspawn (or so, mh root etc.) into loopcyc ent -- cfg script will update this ent as well with next script to call, timing
- check for dyn spawn script __dyn_{classname} - if not found use def __{classname} spec
- mask for new ents - spec what to set on touch (all ents), what to change on timeout (artifact), etc -- spec op in cvar =, +, -, |, &, *, /
- could have time dependent or achievemnt update scripts, progressive ents, more powerful weps, morph cube updates, etc
- also handle genre stuff
WIP: compile stats chart
FIXED: issue where invis, fire shotgun or ssg & it keeps twiddling muzzle flash
- frameset loops & doesnt exit for sg, ssg when invisible
- .frame is not updating correctly when invisible
-- was this in invisible run code - client.qc, CheckPowerups: self.frame = 0; 
WIP: pk2.0 -> git

TEST: item override works
FIXED: monsters that move around need to update their mh to the nearest
-monsters can move to a diff hack (in case of hide or delete)
monsters (along with any other free movers) should be handled seperately from the hacks
-- monsters are now updated seperately using distance to nearest player to the monster
TWEAK: all sub ents are checked against every player position now, during the hide_hack think
- optional code (not compiled) for going back to the old behavior during dm

DONE: rotating door in hip-sec of test_c map
WIP: rogue room of test_c map
NOTE: item translate will be handled by cfg script now similar to the __* overload handling of SV_OnEntityPreSpawnFunction

- minor updates for site links & credits
WIP: quake hack - 
FIXED: odd "trigger" textured bits
the odd bit of "trigger" textured things are trigger_counter, which normally spawn with no model set
and thus are not seen.  maphack changes that, and they are nonsolid, but still have appearance
DONE: delete_hack updated for HOLD flag hacks replacing existing one
DONE: vis block interim fix
- possible work around with vis data from a segmented map compiled into base map chunk

12.25.15

WIP: quake hack - 
- tried full vis data with seal brushes - NO
- tried full vis data with seal brushes 96 tools - NO
- tried full vis data with seal brushes original 96 tools (no water vis) - NO
- tried vis block on qh_0000 map - NO
- tried all UPPER CASE tex names in compile - NO
FIXED: not only are some bmodels not appearing, now torches & flames dont always appear
-- the incidents of this are stoked way up from before, now most bmodels & even flames dont appear
o...m...g
- any sub models that load before:
Server spawned.

Trying to connect...
3 demo(s) in loop
========Initialized=========
- get loaded and are visible, new ones loaded after that are the fails
- so the answer is simple - everything HAS to be preloaded once
DONE: 1st cut - needs revised as it relies on self deleting hacks which fail with a persistent world

12.24.15

WIP: quake hack - 
non visible bmodels -- trying old compile tools - NO
- tried separating hulls - NO
- tried adding vis data from a sealed map - NO
FIXED: bad loop bug -- using f3__ in SV_OnEntityPreSpawnFunction copy loop, switched to glb_local


12.23.15

WIP: map hack - 
FIXED: cfg bug for qone affecting intermission text scroll speed on infobar
DONE: "remove coop player - player spawnfrags" -- works fine

WIP: qh map sections
DONE: qone docs updates & upload

12.22.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: engine port to git
DONE: write release docs

FIXED: dh (default hack) didnt work if e3 - e4 maps werent there
DONE: generic load fail map with message trigger
DONE: some build scripts
DONE: updated docs
DONE: check all doors, plats, buttons, keys, etc -- cursory check completed

12.21.15

WIP: map hack - 
NIX: r_visclip to fix fps issue -- for the time being, this is being put back a bit
DONE: found a vis block work around on qone.bsp -- added block brush every 2 levels
CHECKED: no level "boxes" overlap

DONE: visual studio install
DONE: compile maphack engine for win -- ran engine.  noticed one inconsistency.  testing will commence
WIP: write release docs
DONE: fix key issue with coop code -- fix for unreachable / lava too

12.20.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: gravity entry / exit e1m8
- gravity on e1m8, 
-triggers on entry / exit 
- what about coop, where some player might not be there
FIXED: damage plat still wrong
-- this was the chunk belows unseen boundary overlapping the plat move space and causing problems when the player was on the plat
-- yeah, go figure that
total remove & reinstall of vs015 - which got buggered by pf86 move
DONE: episode local area respawn coop - sp (what used to be each map start) - trigger_respawn
- issue in real coop - simultaneous death will lead to spawn frags - only 1 local area spawn point


12.19.15

WIP: online manuals - sourceforge, github accts
- edited 3.4 spec, some html formatting
DONE: uploaded specs to git

WIP: win compile darkplaces
- visual studio install _finally_ complete and installing
- missing d3dx9.h
DONE: installed d3dx dev stuff
WIP: moving some files...have a permissions problem

Completed in some form:
things to look at - think to ent_load so it happens after all hacks are made
- add in one type of ent at a time & perfect them (nearly)
- put rotates back in - figure vector math (yes! vector math is my bitch)

DONE: copied tools to vxp & updated z.bat, compile chain - hmap2, arghlite, rvis
DONE: compile door section th_0003 with oldschool tools - lot more doors visible, but still had some blanks

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: gravity code for e1m8 segment

12.18.15

WIP: map hack - 
FIXED: damage plats* -- default self.dmg = 1, negative dmg for none
FIXED: message print, had to sub in \n from cvar_string
HOLD: standard quake 1 end of episode win text scroll -- when finishing teleport, viewport is screwed
- intermission messages
-- for cheat - fixangle, cprint time, velo - cheat is get rid of SVC stuff and fake it
- check centerprint time after intermiss
- fix viewport deal
DONE: scroll infobar end of episode text + final text strcat
nix: fix the dang map that has that low hang door thing -- chunks need remade

12.17.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: address targetable lights - test them too
DONE: for any map-hack map, every player spawn should make 6 triggers
-- requires initial maphack_trigger or spawn point owned by a hack
FIXED: weapon touch - hip add in code & stemp logic change
DONE: script entity parm override, cut 1
DONE: cfg to chain levels together for qone
DONE: ent replace spawnflag for map spec or biome func_maphack
DONE: map one field to another in target
DONE: $MHN - map hack name in targetname
FIXED: info_player_start as tele dest, facing angles -- self.mangle = self.angles;
DONE: keys / worldtypes -- need an eyeball check of all of them

12.16.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: make sure chunk really exists - if not, we could load a default placeholder
DONE: 6 trigger fixes - spawn, respawn, teleport, just fired a triggger issue
-- back to 8 triggers for bing - bong or its easy to get outside the box
DONE: respawn and 6 cube trigger set - see teleport deal
DONE: file exists test - change: load code, rotate t_length code
DONE: set a default string hack with first maphack loaded with a valid model file
DONE: delete hacks in func_maphack if: 1. null model / bad file and not a subhack, 2. conflict with existing normal / subhack
FIXED: player could outrun spawn triggers when lefty = 512
NIXED: take trigger spawn out of fire_maphack -- initial maphack_trigger does not seem to work on all maps

12.15.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: updating maps from prev tech. -- mostly, ka_0 had some special forest copy stuff, blds, monsters, etc
FIXED: autofire maphack seems to destroy 6 cube triggers

12.14.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: rotation with vector math
-- tested any angle rotate, works except ammo boxes / explodes dont position right because of off center models
DONE: new hack chunk probability test
DONE: .lefty test for random items
DONE: rebuild of x4 concept test map basic set 1 - 6

12.13.15

WIP: map hack - 
rotation solve: 				setattachment(vhead, vhead.owner, null_string);
-- and this is fail because it only moves appearances - which brings us back to some other kind of engine rotate

12.12.15

WIP: map hack - 
FIXED: disappearing weapon bug
--happens once now, more testing - teleport trigger setup was still flags = -6
DONE: p{n} - select a random & perm tie in - r{n} target
NIXED: this may not matter -- hack trigger owner is wrong on new method 
DONE: hack ents need tagged with system_hash, at least infrastructure ones -- .oh [ ownerhack ] added as well
FIXED: func_illusionary tweak - only initial load ones were appearing...must have been the makestatic on brush model ent
DONE: item rotation, working on bsp model ents
fail -- test rotate chunk with doors / brush model ents
-- best solution seems to be 4 copys of a door, you cant rotate something with an origin of '0 0 0'

12.11.15

WIP: map hack - 
DONE: teleports + random "r"
DONE: - func_*gates - episodes & bosses
-- OA up to new spec, fixed some randomization & biome util where map place func_maphack were concened
DONE: random target r{n} where one of the targetnames matching is selected

12.10.15

WIP: map hack - targets
-- uniq u{n}_ targets added
- func_*gates - episodes & bosses
DONE: event_lightning + uniq electrodes
-- added alternate electrode for exact point src

12.9.15

WIP: map hack - submodel deal
- next attempt - store sv.model / precache array only on true model load
- set ent to modelindex of maphack + *{n} n value
-- worked!

-- this is the submodel deal
edict 54: SOLID_BSP with non-collidable model
SV_ModelIndex("*10"): not precached (fix your code), precaching anyway
- was because SV_ModelIndex was trying to load *10 as a file - couldnt find it in sv.model_precache[]

12.8.15

WIP: map hack - submodel deal

12.7.15

WIP: map hack - submodel deal
- add new submodels to sv.models / modelindex & adjust references

12.6.15

12.5.15

WIP: map hack - submodel deal
-- scite cpp extend for engine stuff

12.4.15

WIP: map hack - issues with bsp models on map & .ent files
-- redacted  --v
***		??monsters_test_code_framechk_is_deactivated!!!!!!		***		-- as local_test_2 - has a compiler message

12.3.15

WIP: map hack
- better six trigger code set
- 4 / 6 trigger cube works...except for hack at 0 0 0
-- 	if (org != '0 0 0') setorigin (chaos_e, org); - in chaos_spawn, wasnt setting org if 0 0 0
- *.ent files load worldspawn if they have that entry
-- strange plats appearing - could be boondongled plats from ent files - still not sure this stuff will work this way

12.2.15

WIP: map hack
- reducing maphack_triggers to only six around player

12.1.15

WIP: map hack - ambient sounds, flames, torches
- seems like when ents copy, the hack trigger doesnt always get made -- moving ent_load after trigger build
- flames / ambient almost done

11.30.15

WIP: map hack - 
- built test_c out for map_hack testing of all genre
- find out why dbl stack map_hack can get overwritten by new hacks -- because all ents are not being loaded


11.29.15

WIP: map hack -  tested without ent_load, saw all triggers
-- func_maphack makes 1 trigger - that trigger tries to fill in 8 to 26 hacks

11.27.15

WIP: map hack - temp removing special ents

11.25.15

WIP: map hack - changed engine not to call spawn_relocate for any light*
- note: will this affect targeted or switchable lights ?
-- got libs & dev to compile engine

11.23.15

had to install fteqcc with apt -- old version fails
bash: ./fteqcc: No such file or directory

the compiled version was not working, but now it does -- so, what did apt install?
-- aparently...nothing?

WIP: framer define to collapse old frame macros

NIXED:

WIP: true constants via #define
WIP: framer define to collapse old frame macros

11.17.14

DONE: move map name fill to map_title_* -- server loads "map_title_world" from world.message
WIP: stats system

11.16.14

DONE: morph fired shalmissle with no target

11.15.14

IMPED: all diff scores on hud_frags_style bit | 128
DONE: convert fallingwater noise* messages to stack*
FIXED: -- rnd message on this is not selected
CHECKED: all "if (self.height != IMP_MCHAOS)" will need order added in later -- make sure, but it should be so right nowish - all done

NIXED: dp / glq - hub observer vote fails -- observers do not get to vote, only live players
FIXED: morph fired shalmissle removed way early
WIP: morph fired shalmissle with no target

11.14.14

WIP: all diff scores on hud_frags_style bit | 128

11.12.14

FIXED: bots still not adding to morphs total -- was confusion over e ptr
DONE: vore bombs dont blow up on vore or summoned helper

11.11.14

TWEAK: reduced bots avoiding morphic cube
TESTED: not vising fact3 - still no ents visible through window, stats says:
(not culled then culled) -- plus clip brushes not removed if no vis
-- client "_-=* [Six]" entities: 122 total, 121 visible, 1 culled by: 1 pvs 0 trace
-- client "_-=* [Six]" entities: 122 total, 56 visible, 66 culled by: 1 pvs 65 trace

11.10.14

redid qc-source storage
added file manager qlnx section

FIXED: 1pv issue of seeing transmogrify model when in 1pv

11.9.14

DONE: fact3 moving lava fix as doors -- better over all but
-- sv_gameplay* fix - can NOT have a door or moving ent with *{liquid} textures
FIXED: fact3 - door lava rise sync funky after a bit -- lava moves slower and bots keep hititng the button repeatedly
-- TESTED - looks good
FIXED:* skin issues with transmogrify chaos - exist in chaos mod MKI -- workaround does exist, not coded
-- but now we have 1pv issue of seeing transmogrify model when not in ccam

11.8.14

FIXED: zombie firing cloud on a moving plat / train - zombie stops -- needs bodyque item fix
NATCH: decided to drop the old method, since its mod only anyway
--trigger_hurt_switch = must be !mod
--func_fallingwater = must be !mod
WIP: fact3 moving lava fix as doors with sv_gameplay* fix
IMP: changed fact3 sky to s6_

11.7.14

-- this is not repeating - long run server test
-- and this could have been dying while connected to a cube
*** warning: player die - Max
 *** warning: dead throwing for - Max
 *** warning: dead threw - 0 - w-mc: 0 - slot: 0

IMP: set ambient sounds to self remove, _fluoro lights as well if not targeted


11.6.14

look at water freeze death of large bombs (deaths of bombs period - have seen some frozen explodes) -- think to remove issue?
-- look into dyn spawn & remove deal - yes and yes
-- fixed 3 separate issues with this - in many places

NIXED: scourge framing to new ai_frame system -- plan to go to generic framing code set revamp

IMP: chain thuderbolt now *sees* monsters - YAY!

11.5.14

NIX: also could not fire a cube on the that transit level -- eweapon link not kept
-- could not duplicate with human or vore (SP or DM after level change, hub off) - fixed?

NIX: savedgamecfg has 1024 off & starting listen server turns it back on - whats more sv_pk_hub isnt obeyed in cfg file
-- may have been fixed by pknextmap fix
-- this still happens, but sv_pk_hub is obeyed by the server, which is the correct behavior

FIXED: q3 mg runs out of ammo - no wep auto switch to gauntlet ? -- because bestweapon checks IT_SHOTGUN & we have shells
-- hacked in x_firecode - really need new bestweapon code

FIXED: sphere skins are wrong after annihilation (not lit properly) -- see 2832
-- YAH - yet another hack

Apparently this is fixed
NADA: wierdness with gremlin armor -- power armor bit is set, but cells are 0 - not in HUD
-- did removing armorsave fix this?

FIXED: weapon pickup override does not check builtin - ref gremlin and q2 shotgun

11.4.14

FIXED: growing rb was not annihilating once horizon was exceeded
DONE: when morphs die they must eject pk items - they dont leave packs -- eject a small pk cube, backpack code, is very nice
NIXED: morphs cant get pki out of packs

XXX: not annihilating heads - seemed to taker forever - may be because of bodyque -- needs tested again
-- heads and dead bodies are non solid, so they wont get touched - this is an HD pack item, where they are different

NIXED: holdable tele didnt set stack1 => HUD wont see it -- fixed below
FIXED: make hud see holdables in pk item area - NOTE: does not show as stored inventory, only when selected
-- using x_items bits for these

11.3.14

FIXED: telefrag loop dealy, and moving up thru level ceilings
-- tho this wont prevent the mega frag out, it should keep things in the level
FIXED: sneak teleport happening way too often - only checked once per ent now
FIXED: not annihilating crates -- was reverse touch deal

11.2.14

Code research for cm-mIII

11.1.14

IMP: hot scourge - EM6X & Ultra can fire lava balls instead of lasers

FIXED: mega scourge has a bad fire frame where gun pods disappear = 20 - only w/reg nails
-- was partial conversion from weaponframe to walkframe usage

FIXED: telesphere doesnt always seem to keep its trigger in sync ? 
-- some code (SoA ?) is setting think to sub_null
-- these were hanging out after annihilation because of confusion in dyn_rem timing

FIXED: SoA
-- also now dont seem to be annihi items - was reverse touch issue - when did this start ?
-- sphere annihilated telesphere, & not trigger - see poly fix


10.31.14

DONE: morph_print paragraphs to HUD / cfg files -- for now, still some tweaky to do

FIXED: s6x scourge shots in ground issue -- at least for now - this needs a better solutions
- this might be SC_ZAD setting -- this was the issue - seems coder got the adjust going in the wrong direction
-- ultra scourge even has 6x fire nearish its center guns

10.30.14

FIXED: map ends (true DM) cant continue from intermission view - bots are running around
-- pknextmap seq was active from pk_flags
IMP: pk cube out of range on HUD
DONE: made crates movetype toss - for grav pull
IMP: color in console cprint / echo fns
WIP: morph_print paragraphs to HUD / cfg files

10.29.14

FIXED: bot morphs are not using archon power (thus not adding to the total) -- call morph_print, bot sanitized code
FIXED: deadflag == 1 bug -- added think fn d_flag to PK_PlayerDie
FIXED: grav was making a ton of chaos_tele_expire -- same fix for SoA
IMP: sgw & reality bomb expand as they run
FIXED: reality bomb / grav doesnt suck scraggs ? -- note: perm change to movetype
FIXED: cube made weapon had cube map code of 1000

10.28.14

FIXED: grav + turret badwolf loop bug

10.27.14

FIXED: SoA touch was not working with items / grav wells

10.26.14

reDONE: last spell select on impulse 17
-- note: *._impulse impulses are limited in ImpulseCommands

NADA: when pknextmap alias run by server, inventory goes away - test with a networked player too
-- tested, worked fine - setup in six.cfg

CHECKED: altarbeta fog way too thick for this engine -- decided its ok for now - only really thick at max distances

FIXED: mwheel select with order after orderform spell does not fire, but 1 imp does -- pk_beartrapammo was 512 - had to be 1, 2, 4

NIXED: order / chaos to fly mode if slip into void -- if they go into void in non fly mode, the port back via void ship code

10.25.14

DONE: improved HUD morph cube indicators, added archon spirit as separate icon

FIXED: bigtree skinnage - md2 skin is not overriding with tga properly
-- but now we have the tga override alpha channel z issue that we had with death knights & red sword

NIXED: -- maybe have a select last spell ent

somewhat of an issue in spell casting - certain spells auto select away from the spell, and / or can not be easily recast without
re-selecting via impulse or wheel - banish, imprison, etc. -- this was done on purpose

Seems all you have to do is hit fire again and the spell is back - so fix the HUD maybe ?
-- last actual cast spell could work on imp 17

10.24.14

IMP: note: dead players -- changed to class_select, so dead players vp is now covered

IMP: stopped hack hiding / revealing triggers

DONE: HUD indication for cubes, holdables
---: make hud see holdables in pk item area - NOTE: does not show as stored inventory, only when selected

10.23.14

TEST: not hiding hacks for bots

- pretty sure this was done -- verify no frags for soa kills

DONE: SOA needs balanced - can go wild, suck up random things, maybe occasionally teleport a thing, living, or player
XXX: adjust q3 shell colors -- color seem fine on the 3 main shells

CHECKED: texture fix on _telepad _dmpad from q2.wad for glq issue - maps & override tga need updated --- looked good for now

XXX: for holdable tele & med viswep_ld will have to add a hidden ent for morphs -- natch - morphs are not getting these, thats just it
FIXED: just hard to tell in 1pv what you have selected -- have v_* now - work great, gremlin & human

Moved bunch of general (non fix item) notes to compile stats file

10.22.14

DONE: SOA needs balanced - occasionally teleport a thing
-- added move code, testing

SEEN: loop counter bust from a prox gren on pkn12 - 6 bots, pl was chaos
-- hasnt happened on new server run, player is not chaos tho

10.21.14

DONE: count morph energy expended by cubes & polymorh - only make a random archon morph device after X amount used (3200)
- note - bots add pts in a different place
-- testing

WIP: release docs

10.20.14

FIXED: sv_pk_hub "0" -- did NOT turn off hub system, contrary to popular belief

this item should be cleared now - even hand grenades work, and transit to hub
ISSUE: x lvlchg may no play nice with all x weps - saw this again in 2 player test
-- all known issue are fixed excepting the dbl chg

FIXED:  dbl chg turned into lg - it was the drawn wep ** - dbl chg is not a spawned wep, but mcode should leave player with chg
-- dbl chg exit - dont convert to lg -- code is in, but testing is a biatch
FIXED: transit in SP removes wep, & leaves 50 ammo -- was parm1 assign to .items

sp - nomonsters, climbing on gens - they go away, and they just go away sometimes
-- this is not happening now, not sure if it was tele-frag case (tho no monters were coming out) or what

FIXED: flamer ever animate vw fire frames - a: no -- was a case of overcoding with EWEAP ref

m-gremlin respawn issue - dcam not setting code right
-- did not repeat on 1st try - can not duplicate, whatever it was

ISSUE: m-hkn in lava w/autodoc - not getting lava damage ! - see screen 1298
-- can not duplicate - wondering if this is a "sweet" spot that we accidentally found

WIP: release docs

10.19.14

.plan file cleanup
FIXED: gremlin hud - claws have shells -- there are other morphs that get ammo amts in various places
-- cs HUD morphs set bits for builtin test

10.18.14

CHECKED: nails ran out on ogre w / pnail - 1 bolt of ltn fired !
-- did not repeat - this was likely the items flag issues with testing transtions between morph forms by dev ops

CHECKED: after opening a cube a cell loaded scourge can fire clg ! -- may leave this as a feature
-- could not replicate - likely same issue as above

TESTED: cant touch pk cube in SP (it changes wep selection) -- test with ogre, scourge, human - no dice
-- not duplicating - could this also be an items / viswep / eweap issue?

10.16.14

DONE: big wep icon for drawn pk items on hud
DONE: cthon scrag flame radius dealy (like imp fryer ?)

10.15.14

FIXED: loaded ac1 - lowered castle arms with bottom trigger (exposed) outer pp did not follow properly !
-- used MOVETYPE_FOLLOW

DONE: map on hud score list - added {mapname}_cv conversion cvar
DONE: big wep icon for drawn wep on hud

10.14.14

DONE: m-Enforcer can get quad-shot, but it is silent
-- uses enf_fire with X_FireHitscan - which does not play noise3 on firing, regular weps use W_Attack, which plays sounds
-- sound fixed, was eweap hack that has no viswep model in e_weap_Attack
-- some frame fired weps (chaingun, hyper blaster) sux with enforcer

DONE: m-Enf & m-Ogre fix up on pickable weps
-- had to back off _fr_attack fix, as that breaks any frame fired wep - need a proper frame fix solution

removed dev stuff from admin.cfg -- put on local config.cfg + saved in dev cfg
FIXED: nomonsters 1, sp, all sv_mon off - hip room has spawns

10.13.14

"Memory overwrite in Sys_Printf"
    * This error means you need to edit file sys_linux.c, procedure Sys_Printf, and change text[1024] to text[4096] and recompile.
      Many versions of Quake have what appear to be two versions of this procedure, but one is always commented out. Obviously you'll need to change the value in the correct procedure.
-- but glq still seqfaults
FIXED: in SP, nomonsters is ignored by generators and spawn code


10.12.14

FIXED: polymorph tele-sphere leaves trigger, ports poly form

IDEA: auto doc max health boost should not boost all morphs (say > 450 ?) -- see directly below

DONE: excessive health maybe should not pick up armor on enhanced
-- includes armor from auto-doc
rules:
- normal armor will not collect if health + armor > 450 - any morph
- inf armor will not collect if hm > 2.0 && health + armor > 650
- note - ignores hm completely - except where its restrictive
ID:  // ablrgh - 10.12.14

CHECKED: m-Enf does not cycle weps with wheel select -- worked fine
NOTE: when demon can not rage, wheel down does not select past it - wheel up works great

10.11.14

DONE: order will make a diamond for soul vessel
IMP: turret limit for chaos_item no worky -- changed limit to a faster timeout
FIXED: turret bouncy head still around - neg. velocity_z issue - cant just set it to 0 either
-- with MOVETYPE_NONE - not sensible, but works
FIXED: order sometimes has wrong skin value on spawn / respawn - no idea why -- temp change, gets fixed in imp 16 or beam fire
--  may leave this as feature, but would like to know why it happens
-- was zeroing skin after poly_check in put_client_in

10.10.14

FIXED: generators are respawning with item flag, and floating
FIXED: deathknight -- sword skin issue still exists -- removed alpha channel in override
FIXED: release imprisoned did not work -- if (!self.bolt_target.owner != self) return; -- got watch the double !
-- found / fixed more faults in this code
NOTE: retarget fails may be because bolt_target is not cleared on ent -- this is part of it

10.9.14

WORKAROUND: * cam screws up viewpoint during cthonings - but not morphing, transmorgify
-- resl fix has to happen in engine
DONE: change where order form 1 fires bolt from, and view ofs
DONE: orders beacon
SKIP: archon vessel handling (collectible items, killable monsters) -- may put this off till after beta
-- for now chaos just copies a thing to make a vessel - this may be a permanent choice as well
FIXED: seen mega health rot down to 80 for a human several times
FIXED: monster generator - monsters fail, some mapping issues fixed
FIXED: deathknight helper still makes mines - which attack the player he's helping -- mines no longer attack charmer
FIXED: turret not friendly to helper monster we own (neither are other cary weps)
-- also bear traps, tombs -- all tested

10.8.14

CHECKED: why firing a beacon has create effect -- not sure whats happening, need to see it 3pv
FIXED: chaos metamorphose view is on floor

10.7.14

DONE: chaos can make a soul vessel or invest power in something -- invest may be blocked for the nonce
DONE: some HUD stuff

* cam screws up viewpoint during cthonings - but not morphing, transmorgify
-- found this bug!  but not sure how to fix it - its an engine thing

10.6.14

DONE: Spell value mins for SOUL vessel - option
FIXED: chaos put too much power into vessel - reverted, when changing back to archon, vessel flag was lost (still had in other form)
DONE: replicate vessel to order w/diffs
WIP: order will make a diamond for soul vessel -- code done

10.5.14

DONE: spells based on power in vessel -- changing some defaults to accomodate
DONE: spell book lists with reticle selector
TESTED: can NOT target god particle, archon altar for spells

10.4.14

DONE: dont target archon altar for spells
DONE: return vessel pts on exit -- tested

FIXED: exp shell 1pv shotgun on poly select spell - it doesnt go away until 1-5 impulse
-- happens with impulse 10 / 12, after creating a vessel
-- really just made it so the selection never happens - builtin / items fix

10.3.14

FIXED: health boxes target as "acquired {n}" -- dont seem to have netnames
TWEAK: stopped removing poly spell list for bursts, now just block poly / metam self
FIXED: armor targets as "acquired {n}"
FIXED: getting items 4099 again, rotating to unselectable spells, seeing 1pv explode dbl shot
-- was no copying items from builtin which was being changed

10.2.14

WIP: archon vessel spells
- create / remove working, add / remove 500 pts working, cant remove below 2000

DONE: dont locate / relocate stuff on hiddnen hacks (see svthink)
FIXED: still re-hiding

WIP: quake hack chunks
DONE: hide everything in a hack when it is hidden -- non solids with models (corpse) might be an issue

8.12.14

WIP: quake hack chunks - some improvments on trap areas
DONE: map hack needs to adjust noway above & below as levels go up & down
- .event on random copy works - 0000 was missing the filler piece

8.11.14

FIXED: rotate tests logic was wrong
FIXED: delete_hack was self deleting

8.10.14

FIXED: latest dp - does not droptofloor on all items, new map compile of test_c has repositioned items (down to floor on bbox) bonkers
-- this is model centering issues, not droptofloor - editor boxes do not match models
DONE: lock out - spawnflags 32 - tomb_time lock time, test in tomb_death_time

FIXED: secret doors now shoot open
FIXED: teleports now working

8.3.14

FIXED: scrouge spawnflags are off from map editing flags because of no 16
- +256 are map excludes -- use height to code in these
CHECKED: re-adjust flame2.mdl and see if it fixes monsters in floor issue, and doom items too high
-- this is new engine not doing droptofloor
-- issue: doom items relocate - check special relocate code 
\\ strongly suspect this is the new engine bufing things

FIXED: flame2.mdl q1 flames and d torches
CHECKED: 
- happened touching a morph cube with 0 archon pts
-- assignment to world.owner (field 95) in server

	and PK_ART is 0 and some pk_items are pk_art things
FIXED: hip items did not randomize with pk_place_item 2

8.10.13

DONE: make sure random map choice cant pick out a score locked level -- made sure
DONE: custom hub control uses cfg menu now
DONE: remove mapcmd alias in favor of cfg files in cfg/map/
FIXED: score_rel1 map fail fails if it uses changelevel - this is a problem -- but now we get to see blocked map for 1/2 second
-- need to test it prior to loading map - no easy way to do this

8.9.13

DONE: cfg files moved to subdir -- added morph, map, & menu sub dirs under cfgs
FIXED: runes are not ejecting, too close spawns -- check vs. older dp engine
--- ish - seems to be with new dp engine, returned to last 11 engine

8.6.13

WIP: Chaos Archon
FIXED: some code bugs was not even aware of
-- some minor code tweaks didnt affect in game
-- super tarbaby had framing issue
--- this item should have been fixed ===
--			lg lavabomb jumping and frames are wrong - on lgtbaby_fly4 he was in $lgexp frame -- does not seem to be a logical reason

8.5.13

WIP: QHD updates, qc, total pak
WIP: HD research - fixed rest of reasonable warnings in compile
-- fteqcc gives warnings on - map spawn func (arent called in qc), models precached not directly used, constants in logic tests
-- use -Wno-mundane compile switch eliminates these

8.4.13

DONE: how far have we come
WIP: HD research - fixed normal level warnings in compile

8.3.13

DONE: deepsleep sounds
NOTE: research into HD pack integration has begun

TWEAK: q2 blaster bolt has mdl now
DONE: deepsleep shot effect mark 1, need sound effects

8.1.13

DONE: baby, mini - new sounds
-- no worky, global max'ed out
///  FIXED global max issue !!! *** !!! *** !!! ***
-- this is an amazing debug
FIXED:  frikqcc segfaults ?? -- stopped on this, never found decent fix, mods failed with running compiled progs.dat with dp engine

FIXED: could not get tallball -- classname changed, but no updated in _touch - x_firecode.qc

7.31.13

CHECKED: death knight may have a facing problem -- seemes to face just fine
WIP: baby, mini - new sounds

7.30.13

FIXED: morph can get pack thrown during morphing -- morph.qc
-- find out if they get packs of vars ammo - no they cant
- change pack code so morphs dont get ammo they cant use  - just pki  -- not doing until packs have multi touch (riffling?)
DONE: color fixer for meld so dont have to change theme to use it (YAY!)
FIXED: blood from crates, chain thunder & thunder

***: loopcyc item takeover bug is found ! -- confirmed below items
-- seems a fireballwep turned into a weapon and then was cycled - may have been dbs issue seen with ogre morph

issue with compiler segfaults is known to be:  32766 numpr_globals  (MAX:  32767)

7.29.13

FIXED: harpoon gets blood from crates

ISSUE: LINK(0): warning: numpr_globals exceeds SHRT_MAX by 1
-- has reared its ugly head again - /O2 will not fix it this time

7.28.13

FIXED: GLSL shader glsl/default.glsl generic diffuse viewtint colormapping failed! some features may not work properly.
-- installed new nvidia driver - with installer...with no issues!!!, dkms thingy didnt work, but no biggie

7.27.13

WIP: pack testing, some issues
FAIL: apt-get upgrade has wacked 3D accel video.  damn.
DONE: checked showbrand

7.26.13

FIXED: morphy lost going to hub - actually an issue for archons ! -- was dbl map reload with changelevel - client.qc
-- archon pwr lost
TWEAK: archon power display no longer gives decimal fractions
DONE: painfield wont affect monster blobs -- test
DONE: power bar display  (infobar - while alive... use block chars - color set for level scale)
TWEAK: removed transparent on some items -- was testing for items w/o archon pts, but all cube make goodies were inheriting

7.25.13

----: frikbot appears to have class_select == class_player - they all seem to be class_bot
-- may not make a diff, but all class_bot search code needs verified
DONE: archon pts for bot if not morph free -- mcode.qc
DONE: might want a console command to turn off bots + alias botsoff
FIXED: 1 pt armor cvt on doom & altarbeta is not collectible -- touch is SUB_Null and pts are 100
-- not sure why, nowhere is this specced - this is a wad q1 item - NOT wad q1, it was translated and code left out

7.24.13

TWEAK: archon power level added to rune print "R"
DONE: amount required to morph -- no = (even to change morph selection)
-- + free morph setting

7.23.13

FIXED: changed to cthon in test_c 8ray room - fell out of level, x chg back while out, teleport save, was firing as cthon, frames wrong, etc.
-- was repeatable - change back in void (or any non lava) left think in cthon fire state, grace back did not change that
TWEAK: lavabomb -> cthon, drops artifacts, runes - because cthon is so powerful, he cant hold them

odd things in last nights test:
------------------- ** WARNING - item with no mask x = progs/pk_cube.bsp
Rex Felis died
*** Warning: pk*bot cacheRoute recursive loop hit 5000.
------------------- ** WARNING - item with no mask x =
Rex Felis: Bomb - Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! -- lava bomb monster
*** RUNE relocating: Vampire near: waypoint

7.22.13

FIN: bot ran thru a vote portal - saw this:
Clan LOLZ [|<e |<e]: I just voted for pkts13
ioctl CDROMREADTOCHDR failed
-- could be the cdrom cmd issued for the real cd player when level loads
-- same thing happened with human player, on exit, not reload
FIXED: tarbaby code called boss_missile which set boss frames
DONE: let 3h sspike set spike mines - use shal code, plus death knight
DONE: scrag upgrade, std weapons upgrade
FIXED: grav well grabbed 8ray symbol -- all func model not map specced to move, wont by grav or horn -- chaos.qc, gravity.qc, horn.qc
---: bsp map rotate ent (chaos sym) is affected by - portals, other mover

7.21.13

DONE: make sure soa kills player with regens / other defensive runes
-- seems to have an issue with autodoc + resist, but not individually
-- fixed by bumping up damage from 2x to (5x + 100) - but I kind of liked it
when walking in to own sphere, att fin is set ? -- no longer an issue as the rune protect was fixed
UPDATE: sky_touch wasnt coded for some skys
FIXED: chaos teleport wrong trigger size -- was setting model = "" -- environment.qc
NOTE: sphere of annihilation annihilates other SOA
FIXED: soa destroys chaos tele model, but not trigger
CHECKED: check to see if init weps obeys ulok -- seems ok
NOTE: strength rune does block splash and some other self damages, but not all
DONE: archon pts for killing monsters, archon pts for rune holding
old note -- points for rune in rune ent, store in vars poss?  add in on rune checks - accumulative for more than 1 rune as well
FIXED: uncollectible items constantly assign archon add as they retouch -- factor var allows this to still happen if set
-- maybe make this a server or chaos item later, for now is compiled value

7.19.13

DONE:bot morph flags - tell bots no morphy
FIXED: lot of monster wakey during bot test -- test
TWEAK: super vore spike mine chances now 15%
FIXED: scrag now seems to use bogus frames & die in wrong frames -- framing was wrong for lg spike
---: 3h xspike wiz getting one pain frame - may be other issues like this
DONE: SShalspikemine may not be happening -- happens, chance was a bit low - 12% is prob ideal, set at 15 for now

7.18.13

WIP: dalpha

-----: inventory select screw up (rotates clg to bfg10K hard cycle, dont see axe) -- details in cer
FIXED: weapon rotate bug - see cer 7.17.13
-- happens because pk_currentInventory == 64, PK_IT_CLIGHT and cycle weapon logic loops
-- fixed in PK_CycleWeaponCommand - (pk_weapons.qc)
FIXED: m-demon jump landing - should not -health or drop runes -- pk_client.qc, m-demon.qc
for single player reboot - factor skill into monster auto upgrade sets - might need generic code
-- double chance of map monsters enhancing at skill 3 - wizard, hellknight

7.17.13

WIP: dalpha

7.16.13

FIXED: can sometimes collect hidden translate items (ref dm4_x doom ssg location)
-- because of cycle item code
we now prevent cyc from accessing hidden wad=q1 map items via map == "repic"
also make sure map items are set to repic when time is < PIC_TO and they are being hidden
NON: quad, no pickup snd on dm4_x --- because of item pickup a sec before this sound does not play - despite sounds on diff channels
WIP: dalpha

7.15.13

DONE: youngling evolution

11.15.12

DONE: globals for fast & slow monster default speed

 IDEA: fast and slow monsters
 - .speed - change in tenths - 0.1 is regular monster, 0.05 is fast, 0.2 is slow
 -- tweaked speeds to 0.07 and 0.16, the previous are extreme on model animations, but would still make a cool chaos effect
- used for frame time, movement, attacks
 - set netname to fast or slow on map code
 - set speed on map code

DONE: put in eng code, spec
 		registercvar("sv_monster_fast", "0"); // make any map monster with this bit fast

IMPED: only toss packs: on Q, PK levels, or from q/pk guy on any level -- still allows dead throw
FIXED: packs & thrown weps had no classname & were many touchable -- pkitems.qc, viswep.qc

- viswep issues - replaced pnail w/ mgun, still had vwepent, wasnt displaying vwepent for firing pnail prior
-  human does not replace pnail w/ mgun !
-  saw frame bork with no ammo in mgun w/gremlin

WATCHED: pk*bot code now sets FL_CLIENT -- consider it so
--- next item done more than a while ago - saver option to restore to level / kill / leave alone
DONE: server option to kill players that fall out of level too - better than suicide (code exists but not enabled - splash.qc)
--- dead observer left outside level, view flickers to interior & then back - ultimately might want something done

--- next item implemented - pkclient.qc - pk_plcfg()
IDEA: run *_mapcmd stuff on local clients when they connect to a server - see if this is possible...
--- next item seems to have been done somewheres
wolf & doom maps for wad = q1 deal

--- irobot is deprecated and totally gone from code
???: IROBOT not needed - can use ! self.ishuman


10.31.12

WIP: bug hunt
FIXED:
- sound_loop bug from telesphere -- tweaked (enviroment.qc, sphere_annilhilation.qc)

WIP: bug hunt
FIXED:
- bots voting have body in unfinished death frame (betting its vote when dead) --- frik in 107 should proceed to 114, or pk*bot in frame 4
--- was more complex than figured - pk*bots that *actually* voted had bodies respawn and freeze in run frames
???: still seeing zombie bodies on hubs - seem to be frikbots / pk*bots, -- bot vote issue (could be pk*bot now having FL_CLIENT ??) - cleared above

WIP: Castle Arioch

- missing sounds on reggun (ulk deal) -- chaosents.qc


10.28.12

Archon is out the door
FIXED: lavablob and fact3 moving lava pit - wrong action (check for lavadead when damaging lava types) -- trigger.qc
- checked darkplaces gamma -- was at 1.0
FIXED: single player - grunts & enforcer not attacking marine on sight -- was morph_test bit test issue - morph.qc
- enhanced - grunts & enforcer dont always attack marine in DM

10.27.12

DONE: release package
- adjust lights dm4_x
- adjust lights de1m1
- lit d2m1 with arghlite
- updated chv_hub to ah_2_0 (_pk) -- seems ok from archon, not pk2
- update to docs

10.24.12

WIP: release package
- fact3 wad = "q1" map items

10.23.12

WIP: release package
FIXED: _jump2 issue in Q100 -- pk_client.qc
FIXED: ULOK* is 0 and wad "q1" replacement items dont appear -- changed logic for wad "q1" items to *_100 modes only (pk_itm_translate.qc)
FIXED: random reggun (from cube or crate) ammo load was wrong
RESOLVED: de1m1 exit loads start map hub -- looks like this was a result of console map {} loads and not coming from hub - in that case, no hub is set
-- using map or changelevel clears custom_hub_loaded, even if we started out on the custom hub and hubmap alias is set correctly
TESTED: maps back to arc_hub

10.22.12

WIP: release package
-- xmod default logic reversed
- updated all cdtracks maps to use tracks beyond id tracks  (12 +)
FIXED: does not detect q3 maps - ULOK3 --- tho in a default for no wadstring kind of way (painkeep.qc)
-- altarbeta - however items were not converting to q3 (sv_adm was 1) - issue line above
- figure out doom1_e1 de1m1 map issues - second had no items ?
--- no items was previous issue, doom1_e1 is pk version release, de1m1 is latest cmII map
FIX: Host_Error: NULL function in server             : barrel_explode : statement 52
--- test on th_stand improved- (void()) 0 deal (mcode.qc)

10.20.12

WIP: release package

- made sure cube & crate make regguns
- checked glquake code cvars against qc -- fixed some issues in pr_edict.c
- tested without pak6, 7, 8 - update coded to work this way, made cfgs & cvars
- see barrel skin issue on visage (map mdl issue - barrel must have changed) -- this is an alternate model issue - needs tested with full install
--- this issue was the visage barrel2 using the override skins of the archon barrel2 - the only fix is to make sure archon overwrites the visage barrel2

10.19.12

WIP: release package
- checked release for ref to previous xmod tite -- Binary file progs.dat matches

WIP: Castle Arioch
WIP: promotional material
FIX: missing haste rune --- test

missing runes still happening on some test levels --- seen this with haste more than once, exact same rune
no --- this is most likely a bot getting lost with | a bot losing the rune
--- check code that deals with q3 haste item & bots, how the q3 item is detected / removed from bot inventory
this was q3_pwr_touch called from painkeep_touch (which already set stack on touch of haste)
haste isnt taken because we have the rune, but when death (or manual eject) occurs the q3 item is tossed out & rune is gone from map
woo.  that was a tough one

9.13.12

WIP: tdo list items from qc
- changing some tdo to IMP: - code for future implementation and not a currently needed tdo

this tdo item (for droping q3 mega health or armors) seems to already be working
---: for drop inv - have to find this ent & set (q3ents.qc) - q3_ha_rot_thk()
--- also found here - (items.qc) item_megahealth_rot

pretty sure stack_search does this now
---: check self.target2 for d / q2 /q3 items (inventory.qc) - drop_inventory()

9.11.12

WIP: tdo list items from qc
Not done - not needed (q2ents.qc) - q2_ctf_haste()

FIXED: enforcer has a lot of fire by frame weps that look funky when fired (lasercan, all bullet weps, lgs)
--- mostly, some bullet firing xwep still hose up, & bfg10K
FIXED: returning to hub ignores x_wep xlvl --- still happening - going to hub prob. clears parms
...: level chg & lost weps -- saw again with changelevel
--- code that removes eweapons prior to level chg (so they dont shift to reg, weps) got borked by a dead threw change that gave all vwepent mcodes
FIXED: manual changelevel made bfg10K into hammer, hook issues too
-- fakeload was not setting mcode - fake was a dyn_item and pk_mcode returns 0
...: pk clight converted to thors hammer by enforcer -- prob lost track of eweapon - likely the same problem - anyway could not duplicate this
TWEAK: always xfer last xwep unholstered across level chg for humans
FIXED:  bfg10k, wrong message - FrikBot was slammed by _-=*Cataboligne's hammer

FIXED: still have multi rot between genres (q1 / q2 / q3)
TWEAK: q3 regen artifact to 200 health max
FIXED: in q2 room - grav well didnt grab all q2 items - see screen shot --- visible issue
--- visible test is not true for all objects in this room
FIXED: in wolf room - air cannon didnt move all wolf items
-- both these issues had items with an origin just in the floor - thus failing trace fraction tests
-- the fix while simple (checking content solid and trace fraction  > 0.65) is not ideal
TESTED: q3 grap (in ioq3) - no default damage to enemy avatar
CHECKED: if hook dmg is right (functionally) --- looks good

DONE: if no exit trigger is on a level & no limits, set a default time limit - cvar to control this
SCRATCH: nextlevel and renamed qstart.bsp for q1 & Q_100 - Nextmap (client.qc) -- relates to e1m7 etc. that need to return to start.bsp
--- just tested this, seems to work fine, must have fixed it at some point

FIXED: inventory doesnt see hook (thinks its a grapgun)
NON-ISSUE: pack is still converting holdable to pki --- fixed by new method where holds are treated as xwep inventory

FIXED: level chg problem with sv_bot_pk - init bots was updating this from unstable data (bot.qc, botspawn.qc)

FIXED: pk*bot cnt wrong (spawning 1 few) on pk levels? --- because non pk levels dont have num from serverflags & BOTS - used different logic (bot.qc, botspawn.qc)
FIXED: duplicate bot name when a test is done... (botspawn.qc) --- original code was way borky
FIXED: on chv_hub & pk*bots did not follow to e1m5 (vote winner) --- THIS IS CRITICAL for release - has to be right with pk 2.2 as well ---------- prehaps, bears much further testing and constant watch
FIXED: hub seemed to ignore vote - .map var cleared while waiting in dead cam --- done by admin code!
\\TEST

TWEAK: using all frames of q2 barrel

DONE: xweaps when _VW is off --- code is fail as is

2.25.11

FIXED: *100 has same barrel issues as xlate (pkitems.qc, mcode.qc)
-- because barrels on init dont go thru placeitem
FIXED: *100 - using x_weapon_touch which did wierd things (x_firecode.qc)
FIXED: doom pistol xlate to nailgun on test_c (holy crap !) (painkeep.qc)
--- was precache setting PK when detecting a pk model - which happens on map load before default translate
FIXED: translate rmv items (under pk100) were still touchable (pkitems.qc)
FIXED: pk100 code has same touch issues as xlate --- think to it (pk_itm_translate.qc)

 --- code needs to be in R_Model_Alias_Draw( in gl_models.c
FIXED: dist variation in darkplaces is in excess of 16 units
 --- changed test condition from < 5 to < 20 units

more gen. gun position modeling, axe frames

4.21.6

chaos mod
current task: visible weapons
pending task: lava fire flare blast

more work on generic gun positioning
 - setting generic gun base point & player model position / rotation set for all frames
 - looking at engine code to not show vis wep model when view is internal

if ( ((int)ent->v.flags & FL_ONGROUND) )
FIX: above doesnt work, need to NOT display vis wep model in 1pv

FIXED: qc code needs to be in post think - pre think has display sync issues

4.20.6

chaos mod
current task: visible weapons
pending task: lava fire flare blast

worked on generic gun positioning (mdl editing)

EXTRA: codged together a simple features web page.  first feature = dynamo.

4.19.6

chaos mod
current task: visible weapons
pending task: lava fire flare blast

coded vis wep test

FIXED: shotgun fire frames not in sync
 --- model frameset in wrong place

TEST: visible wep system works for cam view, 1pv has issues with external wep model

4.18.6

chaos mod
current task: slime flare up

coded slime flare up
--------------------
"when a napalm blast from the flame thrower lands in slime it a) floats and b)"
 has a chance of causing more fires to flare up randomly.  a random 7 - 12 flame
balls are genenrated.  1 - 3 balls shoot out a short way from the initial fire
and then each one can throw out more fire until all balls are generated.
once all balls are tossed out, these then have a similar chance to cause
more flare ups."

added flags:
float FL_FLARE		= 8192; //entity is a flare starter
float FL_SUBFLARE = 16384; // flare up flow
float MAX_FLAME_CYC = 64; // max cycles flame will burn

FIXED: napalm balls weren't thrown from initial center ball
FIXED: fires didnt set owner correctly causing problems with sub flares
FIXED: timing | chance issue caused flare up overload
FIXED: some fires dont stop burning
 --- added master timer MAX_FLAME_CYC = 64

4.17.6

chaos mod
current task: hold | drop items

a couple old issues fixed:
FIXED: exploding rockets dont respawn? (become expl hijacked think fn)
FIXED: splash and thud sounds during crow vision
(still have splash sounds on flame in slime to look at)

FIXED: health boxes cause "no think fn" failure if melted or dropped outside level.
 --- were not set up for set_respawn, added vars so this works
FIXED: fire could be grabbed and not burn player!
 --- fire doesnt get held and touch is forced.  for lavaballs, if hot player is burned then ball cools and is held

Fire is set to be carryable by chaos | cthon morphs, but code is not tested.  main issue is fire going away after drop
Some temp items (like thrown ammo crates) need to be tested for PACK_TIME melt rule

Had great idea for visible wep system...

Planned code for fire slime flare up and lava flare up for flamer napalm in both contents.

tested q2 models (railgun) in darkplaces - works good

4.16.6

chaos mod
current task: hold | drop items

FIXED: things dropped outside level are lost.
 --- check for CONTENT_SOLID and go into respawn cycle
FIXED: you can still touch some gettables while holding.
 --- needed another check in a touch fn.
FIXED: lots of problems with think fn turn off and restore.
 --- not viable to save think fn (it gets overloaded by re-solidify think when item dropped)
 just coded to redo thinks after drop solidify.
FIXED: temp items (shell casings) dont disappear when dropped.
 --- need FL_REMOVE flag for these and lava balls.  flag had to be put in .lip because of FL_ITEM falling issues

4.15.6

chaos mod
current task: hold | drop items

FIXED: when holding a gettable item (i.e. ammo shells) touch gets it and leaves player in bogus hold state.
 --- touch is turned off when grabbing
FIXED: ammo crates do not rotate around thier own center.
 --- offset calculated based on mins & maxs.
FIXED: ARGH, stuff doesnt fall when released!
 --- flags must only be = FL_ITEM, MOVETYPE_TOSS and SOLID_TRIGGER are untested to see if absolutely neccesary
(This reappeared several times...)
FIXED: item solidify has a few issues when used with hold | drop.
 --- coded a new drop solidify fn to fix these

4.14.6

chaos mod
current task:
picking up and holding | carrying items
(yes I jsut finished halflife 2...)
basic coding done, has some issues

added defs | flags:
//	holding stuff
.entity holdent;
float grab_radii = 16;
float grab_dist = 48;
float FL_HELD = 128;

big issue - think fn is removing held items causing problems


previous state of chaos:
-----------------------

hipnotic code base
fixes for many of the 1.06 quake c issues, code compiles clean with no error | warnings

basic user controlled morph code
morphs: chaos, marine (human), scourge, demon, enforcer, hell knight, ogre, shalrath, shambler, scragg, zombie
morph corpse left when you die as a morph
walksounds for some morphs (scourge)
call of the wild - morph sound off - wav's from monster sounds for morph states
random and impulse controlled

advanced inventory system with dropable (throwable) weapons | ammo | items
features: fuse bomb, demo charges, detonator, dynamo, flame thrower, gatling gun,
gravity bomb (pain keep), grapple hook (internal), laser target, positron, railgun (q2), 
beartrap (pain keep), chain thunderbolt (pain keep)
backpacks contents can be riffled by more than one player
advanced chasecam

advanced environmental effects
most stuff floats on and melts in lava, lava balls sink slowly
lava balls can mirv into fires and more lava balls
bear traps break when thrown in lava
potential to float on water & slime
many things are removed when hitting sky brush




mod goals:

minimize changing of original v106 qc on all levels so components are easy to combine with other mods (Frik Bot X is a good example)
- maintain separate components so its easy to remove one without ripping guts from others

maintain simplicity of "vanilla" quake DM...many mods add a lot of complexity and take away from the fun.  (Q2 lithum / ctf this means you!)  Do this 
by:- keep same play style - kill enemy avatars, pick up stuff, move fast
- fancy mod stuff should be pretty transparent to play style (magic, rules, levels, etc.)
- if something new is being implemented, try to make it fit in to what already is...
- minimize control set: 
  o mouse - fire / fwd / button3 / mlook
  o keys - r/l strafe, back, jump, 2 firing hotkeys, cycle options key, select option key
  o best method - hold option key & wheel mouse to select operation -
                  option key cycles & select fires option impulse
  o keyboard only - no mousewheel :-( - autocycle when option key cont. held down

keys sets so far -
hook or feature + zoom - k1 - fire / rel hook, k2 - zoom, wheel - reel hook in/out
drop items - k1 - drop, k2 - decoy or trap?, wheel - item select
class feature sets - k1 - activator, k2 - alt., wheel - feat. select

  
stuff to do
-play doom with md2s & retex
-eye candy doom, heretic & hexen for playing all the way
-likewise multiplayer setups (thin client method)
-get best hardware online for above
-nehahra setup on Q1
*start work on ROC maps in Q3
*q1<->q3 conv (also going to need q2 & d maps)
-doom tex = finish shaders
-q1 (q2) editing in radiant?
-finish q1 shaders & tex conv.
-C&C for Rich!

-heck make some doom levels just for kicks
(already decided to release maps on all levels)
-mean clean & polish existing convs
{
. test new d->q conv (3)
. work on q1->q3 with m2m
. take notes for m2m repl
. compile doom tools
. software quake - linux glib6c (QF for now)
other items
. chs icons on website
}


work on new Ariochs castle idea...
get thins up
layout conv plans and my multi game mod ideas
test d -> q convs
work on m2m
tao_e ideas!
qc -
- incrp LEVELEDQC ideas for items also - "count" field

things mod will require -
 o variable damage by class
 o variable ammo max by class (total max - 255 for 4 different types)
 o variable sounds by class
 o variable models by class - morph code!

changes -
- hook max set by level for hookable class
+ make hook target damage optional

check out raptors return
src - visweap, ikguns, maniac, duke33, multiqc, shubfw!, qdm23

more stuff to spec out for mod:
weapon & ammo improvements for classes that get this
spell & potion improvements for classes that get these
morph improvements / lvl
Problem where content sky doesnt work for old maps...
check dead cam fix pk_ccc
upgrade scourge weps & armor w / lvl
quick load fails - morph fns not set

new morphs - drone, gremlin, manga, fem, raptor?, dragon, wraith
thinking about morph only class - w/subs
all new weps
classes
flesh out chaos event coding
find out if a continous key press can be detected

test plain morph code - check code versus new stuff, decide what to include
good method to adjust player sounds for morph states (arrays?)
use morph for various classes
use skins for diff marine classes - no multiskin stuff? (mebbe limited)

?s
SP - what if you put client back in w/o a restart?

fix self.morphnum bug on impulse select in orig morph.qc

slime needs to eventually melt stuff once it solidifys (test there) - longer time
**** scourge crazy cells issue!
disconnect - static sound & particle field with wavering model?
ogre - learn nailgun
add popping to itemmelt? change to itemremove?
when a player is gibbed can still drop a wep, also when packing check
use something besides norespawn classname to indicate nonrespawnables? re: new inv controls

issues left:

chaos shorter loop sounds should be left to play - add random level sounds to playback
chaos death - more excited or just die down - chance of death blossom effect 
- (explode seq to become explosion?)
chaos - ball mdl = just sphere, more skin colors, spike - more frames for main seq. handle trail models
inability to attack in pain frames
need to reuse more monster code for morphs?
need a custom chaos model

chaos_fire_fly - too many fires in an area, need light, limit fires in a given radius?
- fires shouldnt burn in water, clinkers should cool right away - diff effects when immersed
- fire should land on top of lava, clinkers should remove in lava
- fire sound & flicker light?
- make sure no sound played manually outside of morph sound code during interm
map cmd not handled - should be, spec. for dm - test changelevel in dm on server

perq   - 2 chainsaws, machine gun, gatling, mech, car, big gun, det., new shotguns
shubfw - railgun (q2), bfg10k, flak gun, drip axe, q2 chaingun, blob thrw.
ultim
- Throwing Axe, Morningstar, Crossbow, AirFist, Flamethrower, Freezethrower, Gatling Gun, Pulse Rifle, Plasma Gun
- Phase Cannon, GL - Bouncers, Cluster Bombs, Guided Missiles, Homing Missiles, Laser, BFG, demo charge

get bodies out of floor - WIP
doesnt change to the player axe mdl for stand & run!!!
need formula for extra class items like ammo_c4 and magic / manna

? add splash sound & effects for items thrown in water / liquid ala painkeep?
item pickup also based on code & class (thaum will use mode_x wep bits & have diff codes)
move ammo to 512+ range of vals

*** morph_ammo - redo this for new inventory - morph built in wep - use W_SetCurrentAmmo
fix backpack dropping - consolidate morph code with 106 code
restore items flags after lvl chg from mode_* flags

need a new obit fn
AMMO_ & MC_A dups - should only have 1
need to work in enforcer fire frames for other weps
check enforcer walk frame seq - is it complete?

sometimes dropping a shotgun w/explode fails
test flame thrower & other weps in multi
chance to set fires - flare up in slime
drop wep & no base ammo issue - should create base
prox mine health blow kills your ass dead regardless of range!
fire sound goes on after water extinguish in some cases
fire from mirv needs changed
more generic flame check code
carrying an item to a map with no ref for it
allow dead conduit for all morphs affected

prox mine overblow - check lastvictim deal...

cth - stop on way down after firing

9.16.03

scourge - proxmine and laser
implemented code to genericize health deal with scourge armor
- then figured out what can_get was for - undid the generic morph code above - not needed
scourge - made bounding box for DM smaller - still have problems
scourge - implemented display bar for ammo type & amt
** scourge ** - lots of time tracking down stinger select bug - self.currentammo = 1; fixed
fixed some minor issues with can_get fns
- ogres rocket grabbing code is now only a logic test as it should have been
- implemented scourge rocket & cell get code - same logic deal
re-aligned nail fire locations (out 16 too far & up to high?)
lowered volume for scourge idle, walk, nail fire a small bit
adjusted aim to 10000 on nailguns, still wont shoot explodebox at distances
trying to reverse angle on chasecam - no go, nothing affects this ever!
implementing chasecam freeze - rotation still a problem tho
cleaned up weapons.qc abit with 'else if's
commented morph.qc
testing focused shot for hellknight
updated hellknight impulses to select focus / spread spikes
testing auto cycle on morph weps

9.15.03

updated morph from morph_ccc - weapon model issue fix
adding scourge to morph_ccc - quite a few updates
fixed dead cam bug in pk_ccc - need checked

9.14.03

morph_ccc work
compiled and tested darkplaces - awesome and useful, has tenebrae beat
darkplaces qc research - more complex than orig.

9.13.03

merged morph patch with v106 (v101 failed merge totally)
- fixed weapon model appearing in morph when switching attacks
- hotkey focus for morph creatures
- inv & cc display wep switch

9.12.03

abandon source loaded
tested lights.qc (cool effects, rem. of doom sec lights)
got voidents, medevile, jeht15, voidm109
test shugfw mod (some q2 weps!) - has source
research (looked thru zips for code)
loaded v101 and v105 qc just for research kicks
found portal gun, tested, killer effects!

9.11.03

idea: make mods more portable...
demo whacker:
"for f in `ls -1 *dem`; do mv $f `basename $f dem`dem.not;done"
pure.qc idea - remove code from org fns
decided to keep min hook dist of 40qu
removed hud, vamp, items2
mod purifing / favoring ccb

pk_ccc - chain lt vmodel - fix for ccb
better version of merge for chasecam stuff
all code can merge in separate pieces now

Mod purify markers:
{
/*

Cataboligne 9.11.3

*** place this code at the beginning of .qc:

// Cataboligne 9.11.3 purify proto

}


9.10.03

chase cam context diffs
hook damage fix, drowning / armor fix, hook mode2
credit dir and mod txt file
dragons context diffs
"for f in `ls -1 *-pk`; do mv $f `basename $f -pk`-pkm;done"
research on dmg on shubs pad
{
Meant to mention this before, in the quake oddities -
set deathmatch 1 and load map end, now go to the pathway leading to the rocket, where shub normally sits.  When you walk out there you start taking 10 
damage / sec.  If you die there is no obituray, it just states that "you died."  You can also jump onto shubs pad from the walk way and it does the 
same thingWhat hurts you?  Spirit of shub?  I bet its not in code, its probably coded into the map, quark time!
If you spawn on the pad, you can lose between 10 and 35 health, but you wont get hurt after that.  And if you use the teleport (one at the end of the 
walkway with all the spike traps, not the quad room) you lose 10 health and you are immune to further drain.Spawn anywhere else and step or jump onto 
that pad, and you get hurt.Found it in quark, its just a trigger_hurt, exists always.
Weird that it doesnt hurt you after the initial dmg when you teleport or spawn...
Also doesnt affect you in SP.

tenebrae research - radiusscale (at .8) helps but sacrafices lit surfaces
tried new cd in Anhur, no luck still refusing to CD boot

9.1.03

better config for scraghunt, better config ideas
qf svga working, mouse was permissions and driver type issues
- turned off mouse accel, driver = IMPS2 in /etc/vga/libvga.config
tested - painx, kryn

Zoid has taken an interest in QuakeForge(!)
 - He's admitted that Quake2 is essentially Quake1 with shared object
   renderers, colored lighting (GL only, it's just not colored in
   software), and not really a whole lot more than what we have now in
   uquake that is #ifdef QUAKE2'd..  [This leads me to believe that it is
   possible, even reasonable that we might be able to make QF able to read
   and play a game of Quake2..  That would ROCK IMO...]

8.31.03

wolfendoom test
weapon / item map cont

Quake3World forums

7/6/03

Ho, I just remembered where the quake engine limits make the
destructible wall idea difficult, all static brushes are lit one time
by light...so to break a brush in game into new brushes would create
unlit surfaces.

I knew there was something that really mucked with an easy implementation of that idea.  You need dynamic lighting for every surface on the fly.

7/5/03


I'd like to see a more environmentally reactive game - like:

Rockets & plasma start fires, esp. in flammable areas like grass / wood
bits and pieces get messed up by the heavy hardware in use
(really how many times can you shoot something, even stone, with a BFG or rocket before it crumbles?)
the fog effect should increase with weapon fire, just like fireworks on the 4th
if you shoot a beehive,...

-- could be dated wrong...

5/16/99
chaos texture wad 2 "c2.wad"


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Quantlet Project:

Status: unfinished due to technical faults existing circa '97 (have since been cleared up...)

-------------------------------------
for web:
-------------------------------------
Gauntlet, Atari Games, 1985. Designed by Ed Logg, Gauntlet was one of the first machines from Atari Games. It was a hit because of its detailed graphics and exciting theme of maze exploration. Gauntlet is a perfect illustration of the direction that future games would take - environments that multiple players could experience. 

from:http://www.videotopia.com/

-------------------------------------
add/fix:
-------------------------------------
overhead view, some models will need to change frames.
(food, keys & potions at a min.)

move damage selection to th_pain (hit), calculate on the fly from zlevel (unless bit 16).

monster ai:
only allow monsters to move in 8 dir's of 45deg inc.
if player is out of range, sit idle, nexthink is 2 secs.
dont move forward until facing is correct.
//if rng < .5 * ATT_rng movement is in 4 increments of 16 units each in 1 sec.
//if rng > .5 "    "    move is in 4 increments of 32 units in 2 sec.

select damage when firing potions (for shootable ?)
select score by player action (magic is the default pts)
give monster/gen score in check lvl funcs.  add .pscore multiple.

teleport onto exit destroys the exit: need to test in the game.
=> tele dest will target the exit & trigger.
   make sure a targeted exit is removed.

walls turn to exits:
=>
   trapped walls will have a target that also hits the exit(breakaway) & trigger.

thief:
need to record richest players shortest path. (look at bots waypoint code?)
need to check 1 player start point to see if occupied.

teleports:
should not damage a dest food!
should kill everything else.  teleporting to a thief should
change  the players skin to a thief as per bug.

Tex's:
use colors/textures for top and side's as per screen capture.
may find it neccesary to change the pallet. (Gauntlet has 768 colors!)

-------------------------------------
ideas:
-------------------------------------
check rotp in action.

wizard = ghost.
ogre = grunt.
goblin mdl = lobber.
grunt mdl = thief & death.
may use demon mdl for demon, may not.
plan to use rotp mdl's for player, elf, valkyrie.
normal player w/axe for warrior, check fvf for skins.  (plus qw skin paks)
//more than 1 original gauntlet level per bsp file.
check into using a smaller ver of zerstorer trog for sorcerers.
use 1 of the ninja skins death.

skill 2:
add new monsters: super sorcerer, acid puddle.  2 new weapons & ammo.
randomly up generator lvls. more 3dish mazes, change some of original mazes.
protection from potions: fire balls, acid, fright, blows, etc.
generator aggressiveness ^ with time (1/2 stalling value)

skill 3:
4 new generated monsters.
rotatary doors.
fully 3d levels.  hmm, new effects.
even more weapons.

skill 4:
super power/ godlike weapon.
even more monsters.
bigger badder levels.



-------------------------------------
quantlet progress/idea log:
-------------------------------------

98 mar 19:
-------
Restored quake and quantlet

98 feb 22:
-------
new code for different player weaps, tested, looks ok.
axe spin is kinda slow.  not sure how to improve, need
a frames based solution like wiz fireball.
need to fix mdl palettes too. and redo sword, it looks wrong.

98 feb 21:
-------
reworked sword mdl. redid thrown axe mdl.
got arrow mdl. created new skins.
still have color conversion problems.

98 feb 20:
-------
fixed pyramid kill gen lvl bugs, all related to func_call vs
func_call() problems.
worked on player shot mdl's.

98 feb 16:
-------
moved worklog here to be news page when quantlet has its own pages :).

98 feb 14:
-------
Played some Gaunltet 2 for research. getting a better overall
feel for the game, dont know for sure if I can get this "feel"in the TC. :(

98 feb 11:
-------
modified trigger_gen to use generate_think.
cleaned up some gunk holding it back.
made original gen code separate from pyramid stuff.
modified scoring code for partial scores on monster hits.
programmed player scoring for various attacks.
tried to get past gaun

98 feb 9:
------
built level 4. need ggen mold for tight spaces.
working on reg gen, doesnt work with mdl.
trying to work out think time for proper shot ranging.
need to fix scoring and points based on player attack_state.
t 1 lvl limit, no luck.
made monster_hit from ghost hit to damage players.
thought up fight coding.
fixed a bug where partial score not awarded to player.
cleaned out some unused client/global vars.

98 feb 9:
------
built level 4. need ggen mold for tight spaces.
working on reg gen, doesnt work with mdl.
trying to work out think time for proper shot ranging.
need to fix scoring and points based on player attack_state.

98 feb 8:
------
completed map work up to level 3 regular gens.
tryed to have exit spin, failed miserably.
thought about code for moving exits. (doors mebbe)
some gen ideas for gen > lvl3 
	{
shoot fireballs (l5) lightning (l6), chain lightning & fireballs (l7)
spawn multi monsters, level restore (l7 upgrade)
	}
still need to curb players speed a bit.
put some thought into the 8 level demo and marketing, thinking
about the voodoo2 contest.  think I'd win easy.
last revision of quant.wad

98 feb 7:
------
did more sound conversion, potions, and ddd sound
squashed some sound bugs: no welcome, no exit sound.
found out fm sound is the screwy one.
tryed to speed up gen on first detect, failed.
got level parm crossover to work (not real sure how tho!)

98 feb 6:
------
set up a tape deck for sound card i/o &
scanned in a bunch of sounds from mge & converted
them to waves. got doors, keys, wiz shots, ghost damage and exit.

98 feb 5:
------
built level3 and a prototype level with all the basic elements
to copy from. current plan is to work on the attract mode stuff
conversion, music, sounds, and screens. got the title backfround
scrolling colors ready, adjusted the palette for this. plan to
use trains to make the thing look right.
fixed a problem with a func_breakaway wall containing more than
one brush and not bieng able to duplicate a brush it contained.

98 feb 4:
------
Setup palette stuff for BSP, looks great.
used swchpal to convert mdl's, this is a crappy solution,
as the quake palette (incorrect) colors are mapped to
quantlet palette (correct) colors incorrectly!
changed level design to include area beyond maze walls.
(for overhead view past lvl 100 and walls->exit compliance)
finished level1 prototype, built level 2.
these look awesome.  may change wall texs
that aren't solid from 16*16 to 32*32, it looks better.
fixed a bug where a just killed generator made unkillable
level 0 ghosts (strange morphing skin, no damage).
put some thought into the overhead view limits at the
edge of the maze until lvl 100 rolls around (or skill 2+).
NOTE: this also affects attack and missile ranges.

98 feb 3:
------
researched palette, found out about colormap.lmp.
got some utils, rebuilt colormap, still looks crappy in gl.
tested software quake, looks ok.
researched gl, found gl_texturemode gl_linear, stop use of
8 bit conversion, looks good now. the palette is done,
only mdl's need converted (look out, more 3d model crap)

98 feb 2:
------
got palette rebuilt, finished tex conversion, new wad.
got char in xl & used notepad to rebuild the palette.lmp.
rebuilt level and loaded, looks terrible.

98 feb 1:
------
worked on palette. whatta bitch.  used xl to convert hex to dec
for .pal file. worked out pretty well, still not sure about
lighting levels and the quake palette.

98 jan 29:
-------
started palette conversion, yuk, this is painstaking.
got NI's news setup.  Should put it online & offer it to the clan.

98 jan 28:
-------
cleaned up breakaway wall code.
changed key mdl, frame 0 is horizontal,
frame 1 is vertical, with no rotating.

98 jan 27:
-------
setting default timing to 2 sec.
implemented func_genwalls in func_gen.
cleaned all gen stuff up.
Now only: func_gen, gen_kill, gen*_think,
	    firegenwalls
plan to change aggressiveness and spawning.
func_gen self.delay will limit spawn to self.wait of gen.
-------
aggressiveness will allow more every spawnfire.
many bug fixes:
monsters spawn with proper facing.
monsters no longer spawnover other monsters.
monsters are faster out of gen, pause is gone.
shooting a monster lowers its level.
fire rate of player slowed a bit (little too fast).

98 jan 26:
-------
did some more java research, looks like I'll fix up
the old control bar now.
fixed gens to spawn monster with correct z coord.
implemented active/lax cycle for gens. seems too robust.

98 jan 25:
-------
set up keys + potions maxout at 12.
found single item gen bugs. frames start at 0.
startitem changes think! generator level check using think.
packet overflow occurs at 86 ghosts on lvl 1 test.
single entity teleport working.
dual ent ghost generator works.
need mdl's for regular gens.

98 jan 24:
-------
cleaned up web space some more.

98 jan 22:
--------
squashed some bugs:
fixed gen's not genning till they got shot.
fixed genned monsters not giving points or doing damage.
fixed ghost_hit not giving points.

98 jan 21:
-------
Sampled door colors & put in 64 x 64 mip map.
retexted doors on level 1 test.  need some tweak,
but otherwise looks great.

98 jan 20:
-------
web page updates, trying to get the ol' home page
functional before the 8 level beta release.

98 jan 19:
-------
changed ghost gen mdl's to use frames.
modified code for above, still doesn't work.
frame sequence change is wrong.
mebbe change to the func_breakawaymdl idea?

98 jan 18:
-------
Skinned ghost gen mdls. finally.
coded new qc for 1 entity generator.
tested, it doesnt generate or change mdl's correctly.

98 jan 16:
-------
read qME tutorial. need time to try it out.
dont hate 3d mdl editing as much.

98 jan 14:
-------
redid map for walls -> exits. fixed leak where some food got moved
and an extra treasure trigger.  need new exit trigger monsters cant
go thru.  key is not solid either.
tested walls->exits, looks perfect.
worked on bone pile mdl.  still hate 3d stuff
mebbe its me, but I can't deal with the qME interface.
I cant believe you can't copy an object, wtf?
need time to try a prof-modeling prog.

98 jan 13:
-------
recoded combat, its zcmbt now.
chaff files left:
buttons, client, defs, hip things, misc, plats, subs, triggers, world.

98 jan 12:
-------
recoded weapons, its zweaps now.
tested this, works really good.

98 jan 11:
-------
coded stalling into doors and walls.
tested gauntlet sounds in mge .471, still kinda funny.
redid zai coding. better, but not perfect.
coded 4lvl ghost missiles, dont fire anything yet.

98 jan 10:
-------
Tried a entity treasure box, my 3d model sucked.
coded qc for it.

98 jan 6:
------
tested level 1.  slows down way too much.

QUAKED entries for BSP .qc entity file: quant2.qc


98 jan 5:
------
researched faq's on web and research in game.
Web page title.  built level 1.

98 jan 4:
------
Finished teleports, used 1 trigger with targets for destinations.
Dir facing when hitting the trigger is the dir you exit if it has a target
defined.  otherwise default is used.  used self.wait for the # compare.
(dir's are 'normalized' to 45 deg incs)
scanned some gauntlet maps for the BSP-creation process.
found a major flaw in the findnp search code. now all uses of the alogrithm
are repaired.  generators only fire when a player is in range.

98 jan 3:
------
trying to get teleports to work with one entity. no luck.
the add to vectors for a given dir are way screwey.

98 jan 2:
------
spent 2 days on generators.  ended up using func_genwalls.
fixed fire rate to 1 missile on screen.
tryed to fix score with plr_fire.
generators now gen proper lvl monsters.
------
new monster tracking ai done.
need to fix the dont move whilst turning code.
and add the demon/lobber fire code.
ghost qc almost done. they track properly now.
only used the walk aninmations from the scrag.
player gets hurt when touched by a ghost.


97 dec 30:
-------
created ghost gen mdl for new spawn to handle ghosts.

97 dec 29:
-------
put in potion, treas & food cprints.
new fn for each lvl monster does skin and health.
got potions collect to work.
got some qc patches for ideas.
checked out throwing axe patch.
set t_radius up for potions.
got potion fire to work.
ghost melee doesnt.
cleaned some chaff out of qc source.
need sounds badly.
cleaned up ghost code.  but they are kinda too stupid.
need to track player if in range.

97 dec 28:
-------
tested gen spawn and turn off. fixed telep.
fixed door part of multi keys. got trigger_treas to work.
changed weapon to wizard default, used rl code.
addded potion_touch and item_potion.

97 dec 27:
-------
added lvl 8 wall & tile.  scanned in teleports.  made a generator lvl1.

reorganized wad. fixed teleport targetname problem.  set lip on doors to -4.
looked at qc.  not too bad.
coded health and dest food.  created food model from potion. skins for special
potions loaded on model.

97 dec 26:
-------
checked lvl 1 size, 32 units * 32 units.  decided to use 2 colors on solid walls for
distinction.  gave some thought to skill 2-4.
-------
redid level 1 test.  using new 2 color for solid walls. looks good.
doors need to be a tad higher, a jump against the wall can go up.
mebbe disable jumping in regular mode.
-------
made wall2 texs for non solid to test. checked out some rotp mdl's, very usefull.
got a firball mdl for wizard.
checked out fvf stuff again.  need wizard code from there.

97 dec 25:
-------
Did level 1 experiment.  Got some textures in wad (lvl 1 - 7).
fixed sky texture.  plan to use a 64 quake len unit for each map unit.
exit textures done.  tested gold key and doors, works great, need to change
msg op & text.  looked at wizard model as lvl 3 ghost, needs adjustments.
skinned potion mdl.

97 dec 24:
-------
did 1st ghost and grunt skins.

97 nov 18:
