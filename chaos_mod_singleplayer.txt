What if...the original Quake was the lovecraftian horror adventure it was meant to be?

Intro:

( notes in a battle scarred journal ? )

Home.  Where I should be.

Took the last slip gate (the magical kind, not tech) after killing the big shed sized lump with the tentacles.
And I found myself at the original base where it all started - the "Slipgate complex and main production facility."
After the lab rats got done with it and it went into main production, this was the hub.  Or it should be...

Its just.  This is not any place I was stationed.
I'm sure its the complex.  No mistake.

Empty.  Disused.  Broken down.  Looks like its a hundred years old.
Outside its quiet.  Too quiet.  No cars.  No people.  No radio chatter.  No planes.  Nothing.
Left the base through the broken gates and walked 5 miles down the cracked pavement.

Place looks like there hasnt been a single human (besides yours truely) here in decades.

Found some old rations.  Damn MRE's.  Who knows how long they've been here, but I can still eat 'em.
Still taste terrible too.

Then I remembered something one of the scientists said when we were still on gaurd detail.  Back at the research center near Cheyene Mountain.

"There is more than one world...more than one earth."

Said it like it was a fact.  The egg heads doing the gate research liked to talk nuts and bolts.
Most of us marines thought they were just plain nuts.  Until the first crate disappeared from
Area 51 and appeared at the research center.

More than one earth.  And here it was.

Day 31.

I found it.  Through a crack in the foundation.  Down where they kept that noxious acidic spill off from the chemical processing system.

Magical slip gate foam.  Or fog, or whatever.  And that errie hum.

It goes somewhere.  I'm not sure I want to find out where.

Day 42.

Fuck.  I'm bored.
There arent even animals to hunt, even if I was so inclined.
I've got all the useful gear I could find.

I'm going through the mystery gate...


World 4.

Home is world 1.  Or should that be 0?  A scientist would know things like that.
The medieval looking place with castles, knights and ogres is world 2.
The abandoned slipgate complex world is 3.

Oh wait.  Where Shubbers was - that might have been 3.  Shoot.
Still, lets just call this 4.

Day 1:

And it _is_ great.  No, really.

Dim red sun.  Barely enough light from it to read.  Three moons.  All molten lava.
You can see 'em even when the suns up.
Rocky terrain.  Where its solid.  Place seems to be one giant ball of lava, just like the moons.
From all the eye can see, at least.

I'm stranded on an island of dark hexagonal columns.
Geeks would know what type, but I'd bet the last MRE its cooled lava.

Cant get within 20 yards of the "beaches."  If you can call 'em that.
Way too hot.  Island interior isnt too bad - a balmy 110 on a cool day.

There is only one thing of interest on lava ball world.
And someone made it.

A staff.  Filigreed metal work.  About 5 feet with a fancy triangle at the top.
Might be made of iron.  The iron Shubbers crew used to make magical gates from.

And in the triangle...
Hell I dont know what it is, but the egg heads might.  Mini ball lightning.
Super thingicle.  An odd spot.  Just hangs there.

I've looked at it a dozen times and it makes me nervous every time.
Thing is hard to focus on.  Cant tell if its the size of a grape or a golf ball.
It shimmers and twists.  Pulses and fades.  Seems to shift colors and shoot off radiant sparks.

And sometimes there's a noise.  Like a hum.  Cant tell what it sounds like though.
Portable teleport magic?  Maybe.  I'm still afraid to touch it.

Day 3:

Only 3 more days of supplies.  Wasnt a lot left at the complex after 6 weeks.
And I think its getting hotter.

Aw hell.
I'm going to have to gear up, grab the triangle staff and see what the hell happens.
At least its better than sweating to death with no food.


World 5.

Day 1:

Crap.
Touched the staff to pick it up.  Couldnt let go.  Felt like every part of me was
ripped apart and put back together.  Hope the triangle particle got it right.

And then it spoke.  Not in my ears, but in my head.  Damn weird.
Marines should not have these kinds of experiences!
"Chaos" it identified itself.  And "Ask a question."
So I thought to it that I wanted to get the hell off this rock.
I think "hell" might have been the wrong idea to give it.

An instant later - sounds, images, tastes, other things hit me.  All crazy.
Buddy of mine in school dropped acid, had a real bad trip.  This is exactly what he described.
Lava ball world was lost in the insanity pouring out of the triangle.

Then...I'm back at the Slipgate Complex, inside.  Its quiet, peaceful.  Night watch.
No clocks in sight, but a marine knows these things.
I breath a sigh.  Home at last.  How did the triangle know?
Maybe it plucked it out of my head.  So I have a look around.

But I dont think I'm home.  Its the little things really.
The offices.  Our complex had temporary offices near the building in quonoset huts.
This place has a cube farm right off the entry corridor.

And its populated.  I dont know any of these guys.
Lucky I arrived at night and still had my security pass.  How I held on to that I'll never know.
Lucky too, I got the chaos staff stuffed in a spare locker.  Damn thing floats around behind me
if I dont carry it.  Seems to have formed some kind of bond.  Damn it.

So why not stay here ?
Well, for one Shubbers crew never attacked.  I had a look through months of security logs.
For another...their egg heads couldnt get the slipgate to work.  So its pretty boring.
This is a supply depot now for the Cheyene Complex.

Day 5:

Avoiding anyone above my own NCO rank.  I'm not on the official guest list so its best to avoid unwanted scrutiny.
Its pretty easy.  Well, easy for someone that snuck and blasted their way through an entire world of enemy beasties.
The most these guys are worried about is supplies walking off base without authorization.

I'm bored again.  At least the base commisary has decent food.  Well, when I say decent...
I made my local camp in an unused room down on the toxic level.
Apparently they still have the chem plant here.

After slogging though world 2 the fumes dont bother me that much.

Then it happened.
The chaos staff teleported itself to my location.
Great. Now I gotta move around careful.  Even a bored supply depot sentry might get curious about that.

And I'm getting a weird feeling.  Like the damn thing is alive.  It wants me to go somewhere.
Crap. Again.

Day 7:

Triangle stick teleported in again !
Lucky I've taken to staying in my room until I need food.

Its buzzing like a banshee and spinning around.

I know when I touch it I'll teleport.  I can feel it.
<sigh>


World ?

Day 1:

This could be home !
Its still the Slipgate Complex.  The one I went through.
Somebody did some clean up.  No corpses.  Resupply going on.
Gotta explore the rest, but no offices.  No one around either, but they might have been reassigned
to fight off the death squads.

Crap.
Guess its world 6 then.
The main slipgate has been modified.  Tech I've never seen.
Our egg heads didnt do this.  Thier stuff is always neat and tidy.
This is weird glowy purple stuff and pulsating tentacle cables and odd boxes.
Doesnt look like shubbers style either - they used magical gates made from that iron.

Great.  A new bad ass monster to deal with.  This is turning into a career.


World 6.

Day 2:

Still no one.  Not a soul.
Nothing coming through the purple tentacle gate or the normal arrival pad either.

There is, however, radio chatter.  Just normal stuff on a world thats had an alien incursion.
Sure is nice to hear another human voice.  Not one transmitter on base seems to work.

Why am I not surprised?

Fully resupplied.  Plenty of full supply lockers.  Some quartermaster topped everything off
before heading out.  Even found some real food to cook.

Cooking is not my usual duty, but I'm a fast study.

Day 3:

Exploration is complete.

Near as I can find in any log, the last activity was near 2 weeks ago.
Some odd creature was caught on the lower level, drinking acid.
A bizarre bag thing, with wiry feelers coming out everywhere and eyes.
Too many eyes.  Doesnt sound like anything Shubs had in her aresenal.

3 guys were injured, and one nearly bought the farm.  The pillow sized
thing not only drank acid, it could spit it.  And it gushed it when cut
or shot.

The way all official reports cut off, I'd hazard a guess that an incursion
came through the main slip-gate.

Day 4:

Well.

Shot out a chunk of wall today with my favorite boomstick.

Got so used to the triangle staff, I kind of forgot it floats behind me everywhere.
Till it knocked something over.  Gave me a real start.

After days of 3 campaigns deep in enemy territory, this utter lack of an
enemy to fight is making me jittery.

Sigh.

Guess its that time.  Again.  Gear up, and hit the purple tentacle slip-gate.


World What?

Unknown:

Do I even exist?

I see, hear, taste, feel, and touch nothing.

The only thing I know for sure is that the triangle staff is with me.
I've got so used to its presense I sense it with whatever I have.

Still unknown:

Nothing has changed.

All attempts to gather any intel, make any change fail utterly.

Tried to catch some Z's.  No go.
Really - what the hell kind of thing is that, where you cant even sleep.

Even more unknown:

I do not know what to do.
I might finally be dead - maybe the purple slip-gate was a trap.

I'm going to try and communicate with the staff.
I've been avoiding that since it zapped me off hell-world with the major insanity.

A voice in my head:

TS (triangle staff): Hello...human.

Me: What are you?

TS: Something impossible - bound Chaos.

Me: What does that mean?

TS: Nothing you will _ever_ understand.

Me: Ok, fine.  Where am I, what is happening?

TS: You are nowhere, and nothing is happening.  You have been trapped in a 
dimensional void by a faulty gate.

Me: Am I dead?

TS: No.  You should not even exist at all.  Except for your bond with me.

Me: Can I leave?

TS: No.  But I can.  And you would come with me.  I can reconstruct your physical self
from the last image when you entered the gate.

Me: Reconstruct.  Yeah, I suppose thats good.  Ish.  Where do we go?

TS: Where do you want to go?

Me: Damn.  Always a trick question...  I'd like to just go home.  But I know
that if I dont take care of this purple slip-gate influence home isnt safe.
After the purple slip-gate menace I suppose.

TS: The gate fault was simultaneous across most of their "realm".  The majority of
combat forces have been consigned to this non-existance.  I find no reference
to a master entity or over-realm I can at present trace.  Which is strange...
All you can do is attempt trace the faulty gates.

Me: Lets do it then.

TS: You will have to rely on my power(s).  Any attempt to use the any purple gate will send
you back here.

Me: Oh, great.

The blast of insanity is easier this time.  At least it was something after all this non-existance.


World 7:

Day 1:

Oh.  My.  Dear.  God.  It fucking hurts!
What hurts?  I think it must be every single cell in my body.

After a while I realize I'm on a floor screaming.  I stop.
Look around.

Dim light.  Emergency red maybe.  Place looks...Russian?
Just a guess from the odd lettering on a nearby sign.

Bare cement walls, floor.  Metal beam ceiling.  Conduit.  Love me some conduit.
And ducts.  Gotta have ducts.  Need that cool AC or warm heat.  No place is
ever _just_ right.

God. I think TS is effecting my mind.  Just a matter of time until the teleport
insanity is my normal state.  Who knows what I'll do or kill then.

Dripping water.  No sentients yet.  Cant believe nothing heard me scream...
Maybe I didnt scream out loud?

Get up slowly.  Gear check - I have basic supplies and my fav. boomstick.

Me: Hey TS, where are the other weapons?

TS: They were not properly scanned before non-existance.  Just get new ones.

Guess I will.  I have lost all sense of property.

Day 2:

Spent most of "yesterday" getting my bearings and resting in a relatively secure
small alcove off the corridor where I arrived.

No evidence of any sentients larger or more interesting than a rat.

After exploring this level and the one below, I've decided it is a Russian base.
Most likely underground, no windows anywhere.

And in a similar state to the slip-gate complex after the attack.
No bodies.  Some blood.  Found a couple weapon and ammo caches.
Not in normal places like lockers, secure rooms or storage.

Well hidden, like someone might return for them.

A large room like a command center.  Computer consoles, all down.
No main lighting, no hum of machinery.

Whatever happened, it was some time back.

Of more important note, nothing on the 2 levels I have access to appears
anything like a gate or gate research.

Day 3:

Found a "fake" wall with a big security door behind it.  Heavy duty
old school Russian stuff, like they might have on a deep bunker complex.

Two key system.  Looked for keys to fit the locks.  No luck.  Heck,
no way to turn the power on and this thing is only going to move
with hydraulics or serious explosives.

Me: TS, gotta get through that...

I shrug back a bit.   The staff floated around and a blast of the insanity
hits the door.  Suddenly it twists and flows with the blast.  Ammo, health
kits, chairs, waste bins, paper stacks, file boxes, several guns, bricks, logs
and all manner of debris are falling out of the doorway.

Check the guns and ammo.  Nothing I want.  Old habits...

Clear a path.  Door frame is stepped like a bank vault.  If the frame is any
indicator, 3 feet thick.  Russians dont piss around with security doors.
They didnt know about Chaos staffs though.

Plain gray walls lead away with the expected ducts and conduit.
Base designs change, but they always have the typical things.

I ready my gun and stalk down the hall.  TS hovers behind and shines
a wan light.  I can see everything close and it saves on my flashlight batteries.
Takes getting used to though.   Shadows and indistinct shapes twist and take
all manner of form.  TS must be from some forgotten nightmare.

TS: I am from every nightmare...

Great.  Now I get thought op. ed...  Just what I want.

Not many rooms.  The usual uses.  Labs, stores, offices.
Some research labs have odd stuff.  Most of the decor in this place
reminds me of the 50's.  I didnt live through it, but Pa had pictures
from places all over where he served.

Found a computer...um, a room.  With a computer.  The _entire_ room.
Busted open in places, full of tubes.  Yeah, like old TV tubes.
Who knew computers used those.

Proceed down through 5 levels.  Nothing really interesting.
Find an old Russian rifle, an SKS.  Nice, but too heavy.  All wood stock
along 3/4 of its length.  Look great over a mantle.

Also found some mines, bouncers.  Also too bulky to take.  Everything was
bigger and heavier in the 50's.  Wonder why the Ruskies have all this old
hardware down here.  Probably havent updated in 80 years.
Their mil budget is worse than ours.

Couple hours of poking around.  I found it.

And when I say "it" I mean missing hardware SG-00756-1B, case 155-7-21-R4div-a51.
The missing slip gate prototype.  From area 51!  Yes, _that_ area 51.

I was assigned to the CID unit that tried to track it down.  Watched the guys 
pour over hours of video.  Poke into every nook and cranny at that base.

We turned over every rock.  I had to sign the report as a member of the assigned gaurd
detail, so I got to read it.

Bottom line, the damn thing just plain disappeared.  Was a real big stink
too.  Area 51 has the best security short of the pentagon and the mints.

But... How in hell did Russians get their hands on it?

Got a vague memory of the part from one scientist.  About how power always had
to be supplied to a gate to maintain some kind of "dimensional lock".  So even
though it wasnt in use, it could not be powered down.

Seemed to think the prototype gate was missing some safeguard or other.  Had
the opionion it _could_ have teleported itself.  Sure, yeah right.

Maybe he was right.

High end hardware like the gates have a half dozen tracking devices in them
active and inactive.  Yep, CID guy told me that.  No way the russians carted that
thing off.

If it popped up on their doorstep though.  That would be different.
And where they have it stored - unlikely its trackers could send a signal.

Gate looks intact.  A bit simpler than the production models we used.
Even got some dials and levers.  That had to make some geek boy happy.

Power bank nearby.  Some giant rusky batteries.  Maybe submarine stuff.

I wonder.  One cable is connected batteries to gate.  The other coming from
the gate is laying near the battery.

What the hell.  Part of the job as Sarge once said.

Stow my boom stick.  Take the cable and an insulated handle pipe wrench.
Line it up over the terminal and spank the sucker on there.

Nothing.  Not exactly what I expected.  But then it doesnt seem like anyone
has been by in a few years.  Batteries are probably dead.

As I turn to go, I hear a tale-tell hum.  A very familar one.

I wonder for a moment if the gates really need to make that noise, or if
the egg heads put a speaker in there an plugged a music pod into it.

The thing lights up.  The usual red pulsating glow comes from the side grills.

Now what?

I know the things are damn picky and the destination has to be carefully set.
Russians might have this thing pointed at space.

I decide to sleep on it.  No idea how much juice that batteries have.
But the search down here has wore me a bit.

I pick a room a ways down the corridor.  One with a decent locking bolt system on
the door.  No surprises short of teleport.

Set: one of the familiar q1 base maps with slight mods

mod: new slipgate research tech - tubes / wires / etc.
     new audio to enhance things, sparks, flashes, and so on

Player has to create a new power source with a grav bomb and ? (soa??)

After macguffin activates they hang on a railing, and get sucked in.

< fade to swirling, churning chaos of color, sound, et. al. >

The big "C" dialog:

Ah, a small thing.  You are...
No, dont struggle, your feeble mind cannot quite handle the dimension it is faced with.

A warrior, you are.  Accomplished if one believes your distinct memories.
< "C"'s eyes expand. >
You have touched the flesh of an elder god.  Which one?  Think warrior...

Yes, Shub-Niggurath.  What?  
< we watch a sub-window play out shubs death>

No She is not dead.  I assure you.  Would you like to view her true form?

< fade to a new view - a dismal lava filled plain (maphack tech) --
-- we see a massive creature of many tentacles, eyes and lumps of shub stuff >
< face back to big "C" realm >

See, warrior.  Shubs is alive and well.  How?
Heh.  So hard for you to ken these dimensions.
Beings such as us can not even fit in your small dimensions.
What you encounter there are mere affectations.  Not even copies,
more like a tiny portion of our true being.

Mostly we send them after a summons, intentional or not.
They see to certain needs we have.

Now warrior, think of how you came here - such should not be possible!
A...what is that?  "Device"
Something akin to our alkemy process, such as you think is magic.

Well now...how odd.  Your device uses anti-neutron energy. How could you...
Oh.  You didnt and you dont know how.

Your fate warrior?  Indeed, that is your first worthy query since arrival.
Eh.  Standard process would be harvest your soul / mind and churn
your small flesh into some tasty tid-bit for a servant.

But I see that will not be for you.  The energy carrying you has filled
you with some purpose I would be unwise to change.  And I am most wise.

So, you shall proceed as the device designed - to your origin.
Be warned - it is not what you seek!
